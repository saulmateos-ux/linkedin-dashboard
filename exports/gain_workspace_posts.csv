Instead, listen like you're conducting an interview. 

Whether you ask the question or not doesn't matter‚Äîit changes how you focus.

People conclude at the end. 

That's when they really say what they want to say. 

Just say, ""Can you run that last part by me again?"" and you'll get all of it. 

#3. Focus on keywords and emotions.

Reid,reidzeising,team,7387503171906093056,2025-10-24 15:00:09.354,"The personal injury healthcare ecosystem is fundamentally broken. Here's what needs to change:

For too long, we've accepted a system where:

‚úÖ Patients struggle to access care despite legitimate injuries
‚úÖ Providers wait years for reimbursement
‚úÖ Attorneys spend more time managing medical issues than legal ones
‚úÖ Insurance companies delay settlements by design

And everyone loses except the insurance companies.

The solution isn't Band-Aids‚Äîit's reimagining how this entire ecosystem functions.

That starts with technology that creates transparency between providers and attorneys. It continues with structured servicing that replaces manual spreadsheets and missed payments. And it culminates in AI-driven solutions that predict settlement timelines and optimize cash flow.

I founded Gain because I believe injured patients deserve access to quality healthcare, regardless of their insurance status or economic situation.

But delivering on that vision requires more than good intentions‚Äîit demands sophisticated systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface.

The most forward-thinking providers and attorneys I know have already embraced this shift toward specialized infrastructure. The results speak for themselves: faster settlements, better patient outcomes, and significantly improved financials.

What's your vision for improving the personal injury ecosystem?

""Based on what we've talked about today, do you think it's worth having a deeper conversation about this?""

Simple question. But it saves everyone time.

If they say yes, we schedule next steps. If they say no, we shake hands and move on. Either way, nobody's wondering where things stand.

I learned this after too many calls that ended with ""Let me think about it"" - which usually means ""I'm being polite but I'm not interested.""

Now I ask directly. And you know what? People appreciate the honesty.
Here's my follow-up questions if they want to continue:

- When would you want to see changes in your current process?
- What would need to happen for you to feel confident making a switch?
- Who else would be involved in this decision?

Again, nothing fancy. Just clear questions that help us both understand what we're dealing with.

In the PI business, time matters. Cases are time-sensitive. Patients need care. Attorneys need answers.

If we can help, let's figure out how. If we can't, let's not waste time pretending.

As an attorney, here‚Äôs how I deal with fighting nerves.

#1. I don‚Äôt fight them. I channel them.

I allow my nerves to happen fully. 

Nerves are a good thing. It means I care. 

If I get too comfortable, I get lazy and miss stuff. 

The butterflies come up, and once I open my mouth, that energy goes where I send it. 

Nerves are good‚Äîyou just have to tell them where to go.

#2. I work on my breathing.

Two short inhales, one long exhale. 

It helps tell your mind that your body is in control of your breathing, not the other way around.

#3. I eliminate uncertainties.

I use a simple decision tree. 

If this happens, I talk about this. If that happens, I talk about that. 

I don‚Äôt script it. 

I know my key points and the takeaway, then have a normal conversation so I can adapt.

I was working with a practice in Georgia that was getting killed by payment delays. Average time from settlement to payment: 120 days. Their cash flow was a mess.

Here's what we found: They were dealing with 4 different funding companies, each with different paperwork requirements. Half their time was spent just figuring out who needed what.

So we consolidated everything under one roof. Standardized the documentation. Set up automatic case tracking.

Result? Average payment time dropped to 28 days.

But here's the part that really mattered: The office manager could finally focus on patient care instead of paperwork. The doctor could take on more cases without worrying about cash flow. The whole practice ran smoother.

That's not just faster payments - that's a better business.

I share this story not to brag about our process, but because it shows what's possible when you fix the right problem.

Every practice has different pain points. Some need faster approvals. Others need better communication. Some just need someone who actually answers the phone.

The key is figuring out what's really broken before you try to fix it.

Used to be, I'd jump on calls and just see where things went. Sometimes good, usually messy.

Now I start every important call the same way:

""Here's what I'm hoping to accomplish today: 

I want to understand your current Lien process and see if there's a way we can help streamline it. 

I'll ask some questions about how things work now, share what I've seen work for similar practices, and by the end we'll both know if it makes sense to keep talking. 

Sounds good?""

Three sentences. Sets the whole tone.

Why does this work? Because in the PI world, everyone's busy. Attorneys are juggling cases. Providers are seeing patients. Nobody has time for rambling sales calls.

When you're clear about the purpose upfront, people relax. They know what to expect.

This isn't a sales trick - it's just respect for people's time.

And honestly, it helps me too. When I know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, I ask better questions and give better answers.

I picked this up after sitting through too many calls that went nowhere because nobody knew what we were actually trying to figure out.

Eliezer,eliezer-nerenberg,team,7384604057929199616,2025-10-16 15:00:06.719,"Let me tell you about the moment I realized we had a trust problem in this industry.

I was sitting in a lawyer's office in Atlanta. Great guy, been doing PI for 20 years.

He tells me: ""Eliezer, I've got three cases stuck with my current funder. No updates in two weeks. My clients are asking questions I can't answer.""
That hit me hard.

This wasn't about funding speed or rates. It was about trust.

Here's what happens when funding communication breaks down:

The attorney can't manage client expectations. The provider doesn't know when they'll get paid. The patient starts wondering if their care team is actually coordinated.

Everyone loses confidence.

I've seen this pattern hundreds of times over 15 years. Strong case, good care, but the funding gets stuck in some black box for weeks with no explanation.
The problem isn't usually the money - it's the silence.

So here's what we changed: Every case gets regular updates. Every provider knows exactly when payment hits. Every attorney has my direct number.
Is this more work for us? Absolutely. But it's the right work.

Because when you're dealing with people's medical care and legal recovery, trust isn't optional. It's everything.

I learned this the hard way early in my career. I thought being busy meant I was being productive. Wrong. Being responsive means you're being professional.

Now when lawyers call me, they get straight answers. When providers need updates, they get real timelines. When things go sideways (they always do sometimes), everyone knows what's happening and why.

This isn't about our process being perfect - it's about our communication being honest.

What's your biggest frustration with funding communication? I bet there's a way to fix it.",1,1,0,2,100.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_let-me-tell-you-about-the-moment-i-realized-activity-7384604057929199616-Jrdz

Good question. Here's what actually happened:

Law firm ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí Funding company ‚Üí Back office ‚Üí Payment processor ‚Üí Doctor

Five handoffs. Five opportunities for something to get stuck. Five people who aren't really talking to each other.

I've seen this story play out hundreds of times over the past 15 years.

Patient needs surgery. Case is solid. Lawyer does great work. But the money gets lost in some broker's pipeline for months because nobody wants to take responsibility for the delay.

That's not just inefficient - it's wrong.

Here's what I learned from watching too many of these situations: The more people involved in the funding process, the more places things can break down.

So we built our process differently. When we fund a case, it's a straight line:

Attorney calls me ‚Üí We review the case ‚Üí Money moves ‚Üí Provider gets paid
No broker fees. No middleman markups. No wondering who to call when something goes sideways.

Is our process perfect? No. But it's honest. And when problems come up (they always do), there's one person to call - usually me.

I know this sounds like I'm pitching our service, but here's the real talk: I've seen too many strong cases get derailed by funding delays that had nothing to do with the case itself.

After visiting 200+ law firms, the #1 complaint I hear isn't about rates or terms. It's about communication.

""Where's my funding?"" ""When will the provider get paid?"" ""Why can't anyone give me a straight answer?""

Direct funding fixes this because there's nowhere for information to hide.

Because these lawyers prey on accident victims at one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives.

They pretend they work with the hospital, a police department, or BuyCrash (among other stories I have heard), when in reality they‚Äôre just trying to sign cases for a lawyer who‚Äôs too lazy or unethical to build their practice the right way.

It‚Äôs the legal equivalent of skipping to the front of the line and thumbing your nose at every lawyer who‚Äôs spent years earning their reputation through hard work, integrity, and results.

These tactics don‚Äôt just hurt victim. They taint the entire profession. Every time a runner hands out a lawyer‚Äôs card in a hospital room, the public loses a little more trust in all of us who fight to do things the right way.

Seriously. I'd cram everything into one hour: case updates, strategy, problems, wins. Everyone would leave confused about what they were supposed to do next.

Then one of my team members pulled me aside and said, ""Eliezer, these meetings are all over the place. Can we focus on one thing at a time?""

She was right. So we split our meetings into two types:

Operations meetings: Where are cases stuck? What docs are missing? Who needs to follow up on what?

Strategy meetings: What's working across our client base? Where should we invest more time? How do we solve bigger problems?

This small change made a huge difference.

The ops meetings became crisp and actionable. The strategy meetings gave us space to actually think, not just react.

Here's what I learned: In the PI servicing world, urgency is constant. There's always a case that needs attention, a payment that's delayed, a client who needs an update.

But if you let urgency drive everything, you never get ahead of problems. You just chase them.

Now our team knows: Operations meetings for putting out fires. Strategy meetings for preventing them.

The ops stuff still gets handled - just in its own time and space. And the strategic thinking actually happens instead of getting buried under ""Hey, quick question about this case...""

It's not rocket science, but it works.

Darl Chamption,darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer,inspiration,7382393766390951936,2025-10-10 12:37:11.952,"Georgia's punitive damages cap of $250,000 is stuck in the 80s.

The statute was passed almost 40 years ago in 1987 when President Ronald Reagan gave his ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech, The Princess Bride was released, ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" was the number 1 song, and Magic Johnson led the Lakers to an NBA Championship (and Michael Jordan was still four years away from winning his first!).

Since then, the cap has never been adjusted. 

That means today, a $2 trillion dollar company like Amazon that acts with conscious indifference in causing a wreck could be hit with the same $250,000 max punitive damages award that an individual defendant driving a 1987 Buick Regal could have been hit with back when the average salary in the USA was $18,202.60.

That makes zero sense. 

Punitive damages caps ignore that the amount needed to punish and deter a trillion dollar company like Amazon is going to be different than what is needed to punish and deter a blue-collar worker earning $40,000 a year.

And when they are not adjusted over time, the inequitable effects of these caps are compounded. $250,000 in 1987 is the equivalent of around $700,000 today.

It's time for Georgia to either abolish its punitive damages cap, or at least adjust it to recognize the amount sufficient to punish and deter today is going to be different than it was when the Nokia Cityman 900 was the best cell phone you could buy.",104,19,2,125,18.27,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_georgias-punitive-damages-cap-of-250000-activity-7382393766390951936-tdDK

You know the type - walks into your office and immediately starts explaining features you didn't ask about. Talks past what's actually keeping you up at night.

I cringe thinking about those early meetings.

Here's what changed everything for me: I stopped trying to impress people with what we do and started asking what's actually broken.

After 15 years of visiting law firms and medical practices, I've learned that the best conversations start with one simple question:

""What made you take this meeting today?""

That's it. No agenda. No pitch deck. Just genuine curiosity about what prompted them to explore help.

The answers tell you everything:

- ""We're spending 20 hours a week chasing payments that should be automatic.""
- ""I've got strong cases sitting in limbo because I can't get straight answers from my current funding partner.""
- ""My office manager is drowning in paperwork from three different lien companies.""

Once I understand the real problem, I can figure out if we can actually help. And if we can't? I tell them honestly and point them toward someone who can.

This isn't about having perfect questions. It's about shutting up and listening.
Because here's the thing - every practice has different pain points. If I'm not asking the right questions, I'm just another vendor making noise.

Lawyer A represents a client charged with a felony. He‚Äôs not very experienced. He takes longer to do the work, has little credibility with prosecutors, and doesn‚Äôt have much leverage in negotiations. After spending 100 hours on the case, the best deal he can get is a plea for five years in prison.

Lawyer B is a respected, highly experienced defense lawyer. She doesn‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel. She spends 10 hours on the case. Because of her expertise, skill, and reputation with prosecutors, she negotiates a plea where the client gets probation.

Now, critics of contingency fees who argue fees should be tied to time spent would say Lawyer A deserves more money because he worked ten times as long as Lawyer B. 

But does that make any sense at all? Does it make sense to say Lawyer B got a ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù simply because her skill, experience, and reputation allowed her to achieve a far better outcome in less time? Of course not.

Time doesn't equal value to the client, and our clients don‚Äôt care how many hours are spent. They care about results. The lawyer who delivers the better outcome is the one who provides the greater value and deserves the higher fee. 

The same principle applies in personal injury cases. The more money recovered for the client, the higher the fee, even if everyone charged the same percentage (which they don't). That‚Äôs not a windfall. It‚Äôs the fair recognition that results matter.

The ABA Model Rules even acknowledge this. Reasonableness of a fee depends on factors like ‚Äúthe amount involved and the results obtained,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúthe experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer.‚Äù

At the end of the day, clients don‚Äôt hire us to log hours. They hire us to deliver outcomes. And the lawyer who delivers the better result isn‚Äôt worth less, even if it takes them less time to get the result. They‚Äôre worth more.",140,42,3,185,30.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_which-lawyer-should-be-paid-a-higher-fee-activity-7376966291548475392-_n9k

When I look back at the fastest-moving partnerships we‚Äôve built at Gain‚Äîproviders, firms, funders‚Äîthere‚Äôs one thing they all had in common:

Response speed wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfast.‚Äù It was immediate.
Not just for ego.
Not just to look sharp.

But because the work mattered enough to not sit in limbo.

The providers who‚Äôve scaled with us?
They move on funding requests in hours, not days.

The firms who close more cases?
They don‚Äôt ghost paperwork for 10 days and blame ‚Äúbacklog.‚Äù

The top teams I‚Äôve worked with over the years‚Äî
they treat momentum like an asset.
Not hustle.
Not 24/7 Slack addiction.
But a shared rhythm.
Because when communication moves fast, trust compounds.
And when trust compounds, so does output.

So if you‚Äôre wondering why your team feels stuck, bloated, or scattered‚Äî
don‚Äôt just look at tools.

Look at timing.
Clarity doesn‚Äôt wait. Neither should replies.

But the money? 

It might not arrive for 6, 12, or even 18 months.

That‚Äôs not bad luck‚Äîit‚Äôs a systems issue.

And it‚Äôs one of the biggest risks in lien-backed care.

Most practices I speak with still track liens in spreadsheets, chase attorneys manually, and cross their fingers for payment.

Meanwhile:

- High-value claims go cold

- Staff burn out on follow-ups

- Collections remain unpredictable

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

Revenue isn‚Äôt just lost to denials‚Äîit‚Äôs lost to disorganization.

When you don‚Äôt know which cases are close to settlement, which firms are slow to respond, or which docs are missing‚Äîevery lien becomes a liability.

The solution isn‚Äôt more effort.

It‚Äôs more visibility.

When you centralise med-legal workflows and automate attorney follow-ups, lien-based care becomes what it was always meant to be: high-margin, high-impact, and finally‚Äîpredictable.

How are you tracking your open liens today?

Yet too many firms still struggle to connect case outcomes to actual collections. 
Why? 

Because:
- Open liens live in spreadsheets or email threads
- Case progress isn‚Äôt linked to revenue forecasts
- Delays and bottlenecks quietly eat into cash flow

To move from guesswork ‚Üí predictability, firms need to track:
- Lien progresses through each stage
- Recovery timing versus expectations
- High-risk cases before they turn into write-offs

Predictable revenue starts by knowing which cases are likely to pay‚Äîand which need attention before cash slips away.

At Gain, we tie every case outcome to collections and recovery timelines, helping your firm act faster, prioritize effectively, and forecast revenue with confidence.

‚ÄúDo they genuinely care?‚Äù

Not just about the title or the perks. But about the work. The mission. The outcomes. 

About doing things right, especially when it‚Äôs hard, unclear, or unglamorous.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen‚Äîover and over again:

1 People who care deeply will figure things out. 

2 People who care take ownership, even when no one‚Äôs watching. 

3 People who don‚Äôt? 

Eventually slow everything down‚Äîno matter how sharp their resume looks.

I‚Äôve worked in operationally intense environments‚Äîwhere timing is everything, follow-through is critical, and breakdowns have real downstream consequences.

In those environments, caring isn‚Äôt a bonus trait‚Äîit‚Äôs core infrastructure.

That‚Äôs why, when I hire, I don‚Äôt just look for experience. 

I listen for evidence of care:

What‚Äôs the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever worked on?

Why did it matter to you?

What kept you going when things got hard?

What are you most proud of?

Was it worth it?

The best people? They don‚Äôt just recall the result‚Äîthey remember the effort. 

The obsession. The commitment. 

Because for them, caring is the baseline‚Äînot the exception.

That‚Äôs who you build teams with. Everything else is just window dressing.

(Photo of the G-Wagon is in the comments).

GTLA's President took issue with the gaudy vehicle and its owner's strategic placement of it directly in front of the Cloister as it hosted the seminar. And he let everyone know it. Those comments resulted in this defamation lawsuit.

But this isn‚Äôt really about one lawyer or one case. It‚Äôs about the dichotomy in our profession.

On one side: bad-taste advertisers who plaster gimmicks, slogans, and shock value across cars, billboards, and TV screens. They don‚Äôt think twice about how their image reflects on all of us. They just care about trying to get cases (even though I would argue people attracted to a G-Wagon covered in $100 bills are not likely to have the best quality cases).

On the other: lawyers who care deeply about how our profession is portrayed. Lawyers who believe being a personal injury lawyer means something more than trying to be the loudest and showiest. Lawyers who believe doing great work and building trust is the best way to build a law firm. 

The public already struggles to separate settlement mills from real trial lawyers. When someone drives up to a legal conference in a $100-bill-wrapped luxury SUV, it doesn‚Äôt just hurt their reputation; it hurts all of ours.

We can debate tort reform and legislative battles all day, but the truth is this: how we carry ourselves matters. The image we project to the world either elevates the profession, or drags it down.

This lawsuit should be a reminder about how important it is that we are responsible with our brand messaging.

Bad wreck where the other driver ran a red light. Good client who is in his mid-40s. Multiple rounds of injections before ultimately undergoing back surgery. Medical bills over $100K. 

This offer represents the insurer saying the total damages here are $108,972.16. Do they really think that? I doubt it. 

So why did they make the offer? Simple. There's little to no consequence for UM carriers acting in bad faith and making low-ball offers in Georgia. As a result, UM carriers make low offers and just see if the plaintiff will bite. 

Deny, delay, defend. That's their strategy. Maybe the plaintiff will give up. Maybe they won't. But in the meantime, the insurer gets to keep the money and earn interest on it.

Here's the irony. If this was a liability policy of $300K, it almost certainly would have paid because there's real consequences to not paying. Our client's own UM carrier is treating him worse than the third-party defendant's liability carrier would. It makes no sense. But it's the reality I encounter every day.

Here's a simple fix for this problem. Strengthen UM bad faith laws so that carriers cannot drag their insurers through years of litigation and burden the courts, and make it clear that Georgia's offer of settlement statute applies to UM claims. 

Until there are changes, we're going to continue to see absurdly low offers on UM claims.",182,34,5,221,18.68,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_8397216-thats-an-offer-we-got-from-allstate-activity-7374431436617031680-llh-

In the bigger cases with big coverage the real offers only come after the case is ready for trial and has either already been called, or there is a substantial certainty that it will be called.

You want the fair offers? You gotta be ready to take it all the way to the door. And I don‚Äôt mean file it and limp all the way to the trial date in the hopes that the good offer will come.

I mean properly work it up for trial so that when you line up the other side knows you‚Äôre not about to blink. 

Even so, the real offers are unlikely to come the first time the case is up for trial. If you‚Äôre any good you‚Äôve moved the case quickly, so you‚Äôll be competing in the trial order with 5+ year old cases. 

The chances that your number gets called is low, so the insurance company is probably still going to be willing to play chicken at that point. But once you get past that first trial setting without blinking, every time the case comes up for trial the offers will get a little more real.

The realest offers? Those come when you get that email from the court to show up to try the case. 

You can try to argue with me on this, but it‚Äôs really not up for debate. It‚Äôs the reality we live in.

So if you have big cases with big coverage, you need to be ready, willing and able to take it the distance.

Back in the day, I used to give them some weight. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre offering X‚Ä¶ does that mean my valuation is off? Do they know something I don‚Äôt? Should I factor this into my posture?‚Äù

But the longer I played this game, the clearer it became: most insurance company offers aren‚Äôt based on reality. They‚Äôre not rooted in risk assessment or fair value, they‚Äôre wishful thinking.

Waiting for a verdict. I hate it, I hate every second of it. 

Sitting around the courtroom wondering what they‚Äôre thinking about or talking about. Hoping they‚Äôre not back there focusing on something you missed or undervalued. Making bets as to how long you think they‚Äôll be out.

If they come back too quick it‚Äôs a bad sign. If they take long it‚Äôs a good sign. Or maybe it‚Äôs the inverse. But more likely there probably is no actual correlation between time and outcomes.

Whether these things are true or not doesn‚Äôt really matter. These are the kinds of things we keep ourselves busy with so we can get by the awful combination of high stress and numbing boredom.

And then there‚Äôs the door. Every time the door to chambers opens and court personnel walks out you wonder if they‚Äôre going to announce that the jury came back with a verdict. The great majority of the time? It‚Äôs just the bailiff bringing some water, or the judge who probably got bored of being in chambers by themselves and comes into the courtroom to chat. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I hate this part of trial so much. Maybe it‚Äôs the fact that by this point there‚Äôs nothing else we can do to affect the outcome. Maybe it‚Äôs the realization that the game has been fully played, yet you don‚Äôt know the score.

In any case, I don‚Äôt think this part will ever get easier for me.

The murder of Charlie Kirk is a perfect example. From what little we know so far it looks like someone who found his message hateful chose to answer that message with lethal violence. 

Lethal violence in this circumstance can be described as nothing other than the ultimate act of hate. 

A person conducting such an act of hate cannot, by definition, be said to hold strong values of love and unity. 

On the other side of this, we are seeing swaths of people who purport to believe in the free expression of ideas, no matter how controversial, rejoice the firing of countless of people for expressing reprehensible ideas about the murder of Charlie Kirk. 

The punishment of speech is the antithesis of a deeply held belief that free speech is a cornerstone of a working society. 

The truth is that we as a society no longer have deeply held beliefs. The same people who today are ardent defenders of free speech will tomorrow look to extinguish opinions they find unpopular. 

And I wish I could say this was a left or a right thing, because at least some large percentage of the population could be said to stand for something. But it isn‚Äôt. 

Today‚Äôs firings over opinions about Kirk are yesterday‚Äôs firings over opinions on COVID.

Today‚Äôs proponents of the firings over Kirk are yesterday‚Äôs loud opponents of the firings over COVID.

Tomorrow it‚Äôll be something else. And people will just find a way to justify making a 180 degree turn on what they support.

In retail, there‚Äôs a concept called a loss leader: selling a product at or below cost to bring people in the door, knowing it builds loyalty and drives long-term growth. Example:  Costco's $1.50 hot dog combo that has had the same price for 40 years.

Personal injury law has its version of loss leaders, too.

At The Champion Firm, we often take smaller cases where, based on the way we staff and handle them, we know we‚Äôre probably losing money on them, or at best, breaking even.

Why? Because we look at the big picture, not just the numbers on one case. This fits with my own personal values and the values I want the firm to have:  we are here to help people, not just make money. 

Despite any altruistic motives, there are real benefits to doing this that extend far beyond a dollar-and-cents calculation. Here's what these cases allow us to do:

Build our reputation ‚Üí When we help, people remember it.

Grow our client base ‚Üí A ‚Äúsmall case‚Äù client today might refer a catastrophic case tomorrow.

Generate referrals ‚Üí Other lawyers who trust us with smaller or mid-size cases often send us the big ones when they come along.

Earn Google reviews ‚Üí Real results for real people build trust in our community.

Train the next generation ‚Üí They provide a learning ground for less experienced attorneys to sharpen their skills.

And there‚Äôs another piece that matters just as much: client referrals.

When we deliver for our clients, no matter the size of the case, they send their friends, family, and coworkers to us. That steady stream of referrals allows us to help more people and build lasting relationships.

We don‚Äôt want to be their lawyer for just one case. We want to be their lawyers for life. And if we started turning down client referrals just because the case wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbig enough,‚Äù how could we ever truly be there for them when they need us?

If we treated every case like a stand-alone profit center, we‚Äôd miss out on these opportunities. And, more importantly, we‚Äôd miss out on helping good people who need us.",51,10,1,62,19.61,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_not-every-case-we-accept-is-about-whether-activity-7370447840273145856-q3zQ

The growing crackdown on third-party litigation funding is understandable. 

But not all funding is created equal.

At Gain, we sit at the intersection of patient care and case outcomes‚Äîsupporting providers who treat on lien so injured people can get care before a settlement comes through.

The challenge?

Regulators are conflating med-legal servicing with speculative litigation funding models. 

 Its dangerous, as it risks cutting off access to care and bankrupting providers for following the rules.

We‚Äôre not betting on legal outcomes. 

We‚Äôre supporting care that‚Äôs already been delivered‚Äîand tying revenue to case progress in a transparent, accountable way.

If lawmakers want to regulate this space, they should. 

But they need to regulate the right thing.

Here's what I've seen from attorneys who try to manipulate the narrative rather than deal with the issues in front of them. 

üö© Answering selectively. You send a letter or email with multiple issues or questions, and they respond to one‚Ä¶ maybe two‚Ä¶ and conveniently ignore the rest.

üö© Rewriting history. They invent things that never happened and play dumb when you point out that they are wrong. 

üö© Moving the goalposts. Agreeing to something one day, then denying they ever agreed to it the next, or subtly changing their position to make whatever agreement they had in place completely meaningless. 

üö© Mischaracterizing your positions. Twisting your words in filings or correspondence to create arguments you never made.

üö© Taking facts and the record out of context. Here's an example: a lawyer recently accused me of violating a court order in how discovery disputes would be addressed...based on an order from another case that had not been entered in this case. This same lawyer who had not provided substantive discovery responses when his responses were due pointed out, ""the plaintiff has not answered discovery yet either."" Yes, because we just got served with discovery and our response deadline was still weeks away!

Gaslighting isn‚Äôt just frustrating. It's a tactic that subpar attorneys use because that's the game they know. They don't know how to win, or simply can't win, on the merits so they obstruct, obfuscate, and confuse. The goal is to make you second-guess yourself, burn your time, and distract you and the court from the real issues.

Being an effective lawyer isn't about gamesmanship. It isn't about using the litigation process to delay, obstruct, and confuse.

My approach? Document everything. Keep emails tight, confirm agreements in writing, and never let someone else rewrite the record. And don't get involved in the sideshow circus they are trying to distract you with. Keep your focus on what you need to prove in your case and do what you need to do to win your case.

Is it frustrating? Yes. But ultimately, the gaslighting attorneys get exposed and their clients end up worse off for it.",92,20,1,113,21.74,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_beware-of-gaslighting-attorneys-heres-activity-7369074906279419905-RykY

If you're still managing cases manually‚Äîusing spreadsheets, emails, and waiting for attorneys to follow through‚Äîyou might be missing out on hundreds of thousands in lost collections.

Here are 3 major pain points many healthcare providers face:

1. Manual Tracking - Missed updates, delays, and errors are inevitable.
2. Poor Attorney Communication - Disputes over reduced payments or missing documentation.
3. No Clear Payment Predictions - Guesswork when it comes to knowing when settlements will happen.

The good news?

You don't need to hire more staff to solve this. The future of PI collections lies in AI-driven automation that helps streamline the entire case process‚Äîfrom intake to payment.

While many states focus on what the survivors lost, Georgia law measures the damages from the viewpoint of the deceased. 

The law asks: ‚Äúwhat did the deceased lose‚Äú? This includes an economic and non-economic component with the non-economic damages being traditional loss of enjoyment of life damages.

When somebody dies, the estate also has a claim for pre-death pain and suffering, funeral expenses, and all medical expenses and lost wages from the time of the injury until the time of death.

Get the docs. Get the signatures. Get the approval.
But I was wrong.
Because what really slows things down isn‚Äôt process.
It‚Äôs opacity.
Too many stakeholders.
Too many emails with no clear owner.
Cases stalled. Providers left waiting.
Patients stuck in limbo while funding sat in someone‚Äôs inbox.
That‚Äôs when I realised:
PI funding didn‚Äôt need more tech.
It needed more truth.
So we stripped it all down and rebuilt it‚Äîat Gain.
‚Üí No middlemen. Just a direct line from provider and attorney to funder.
‚Üí No markup games. Just transparent economics everyone understands.
‚Üí No black boxes. Just real-time visibility into where a case stands.
This isn‚Äôt just about speeding up approvals (though we often do it in 48 hours).
It‚Äôs about operational clarity in a space that‚Äôs built on chaos.
Because when funding flows, care gets delivered.
When attorneys aren‚Äôt chasing signatures, cases move.
When providers trust the system, they show up ready.
That‚Äôs the difference a clean infrastructure makes.
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building at Gain.

The only time we pick dates and send notices or subpoenas is if we do not get dates after repeated requests. Even then, we include a cover letter or email that outlines our prior attempts to schedule the deposition and offers to re-set it for a mutually agreeable place and time.

Yet I have a case now where defense counsel did not do that. No attempts to schedule the deposition with me. No requests for dates. And then out of nowhere unilateral notices and subpoenas sent for two whole days of depositions of non-party witnesses to take place in 3 weeks.

Your traditional venue factors are still going to weigh in favor of state court. The procedural changes brought about by SB68 that will not apply in federal court are not significant enough to move the needle in favor of filing there.

And regardless, defendants can still override our state v. federal venue decision if we file in state court if there‚Äôs federal subject matter jurisdiction (unless it‚Äôs a diversity action and the forum defendant rule applies). 

If you are deciding whether to file in state v. federal court to try to avoid parts of SB68, don‚Äôt overthink it.

The way most clinics handle PI collections hasn‚Äôt changed in years:

- Spreadsheets

- Missed updates

- Slow attorney follow-ups

- No clarity on payment timelines

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî You don‚Äôt need more staff. 

You need a smarter system.

The most efficient clinics I work with aren‚Äôt just working harder. They‚Äôre working predictively.

That means:

- Tracking every lien from intake to settlement

- Getting real-time alerts the moment a case progresses

- Knowing which attorneys delay, reduce, or pay in full

- Forecasting expected collections with confidence

- Automating payment requests so money doesn‚Äôt sit idle

Most clinics don‚Äôt fail to collect because they‚Äôre careless. They fail because they‚Äôre stuck managing PI the old way‚Äîmanually.

If you‚Äôve ever said: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even know the case settled,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why we weren‚Äôt paid in full‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably not your team. It‚Äôs your system.

That‚Äôs where Lien Scoring changes everything.

What Should Your AR Stack Be Tracking?

It‚Äôs more than just balances‚Äîit‚Äôs about signals that drive recovery:

1. Documentation Status
 
    Missing LOPs or billing packets = denial risk
 
2. Legal Progress
 
    Filed vs. pre-lit vs. trial drastically shifts velocity
 
3. Claim Metadata
 
    Case type and jurisdiction = huge predictability factor
 

With scoring, each lien is benchmarked like a real financial asset.

You gain clarity on:

- Which liens are at risk?

- Which will likely convert?

- When to act and where to prioritize?

At Gain, we automate lien scoring across your entire portfolio‚Äîso your team stops chasing and starts forecasting.

AR isn‚Äôt just about aging. It‚Äôs about liquidation strategy.

They carefully select those who are willing to absorb their toxic behavior without pushing back, because it gives them a sense of control and superiority. In these relationships, the narcissist rarely faces real consequences for their actions. Instead, they exploit the patience and forgiveness of others, often wearing them down over time. The more someone tolerates their manipulation, gaslighting, and emotional abuse, the more empowered the narcissist feels. This creates a dangerous cycle where the victim‚Äôs voice becomes smaller and their boundaries disappear altogether.

Narcissists fear confrontation because it threatens their carefully constructed image of perfection and control. When faced with even mild resistance, they may react with anger, blame-shifting, or withdrawal, further isolating those who dare to speak up. This is why they prefer to stay with people who won‚Äôt challenge them, who will let them off the hook again and again. Unfortunately, this often leads to the victim losing their sense of self, feeling trapped in a relationship that is damaging and exhausting.

Recognizing this pattern is crucial. It‚Äôs not about blaming yourself for what you‚Äôve tolerated, but about understanding the dynamics at play so you can begin to set healthy boundaries. When you stop tolerating the unacceptable, you take back your power‚Äîand that is when true healing and freedom begin.

Coincidence? Maybe.

But the pattern fits what research shows about private equity in healthcare: when private equity takes over, patient care often suffers.

For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study found that Medicare patients at private equity-owned hospitals suffered:

üö©25% more hospital-acquired complications
üö©38% more bloodstream infections from central lines (despite placing 16% fewer lines)
üö©Double the rate of surgical site infections
üö©27% more patient falls, even as falls elsewhere declined nationwide

These outcomes have been linked to the unique financial pressures private equity ownership brings, including cost-cutting measures like reducing staffing. These financial pressures can have real and dangerous consequences for patients.

Darl Chamption,darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer,inspiration,7359621603338383360,2025-08-08 16:28:45.393,"Think that the Georgia Supreme Court's June decision in Turner has resurrected medical malpractice caps from the dead? Not so fast.

After the Georgia Supreme Court‚Äôs Turner decision this June, defendants are now arguing that the caps still apply in wrongful death cases.

Their argument: Nestlehutt doesn‚Äôt apply to wrongful death claims because such claims didn‚Äôt exist at common law, and there‚Äôs no constitutional jury trial right for them. Therefore, they say, the cap is valid in that context.

But Turner didn‚Äôt say that. The Court simply held that Nestlehutt didn‚Äôt decide the issue and directed lower courts to apply Nestlehutt‚Äôs analytical framework.

Here‚Äôs several reasons why the cap still can't apply to wrongful death claims:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Wrongful death damages are analogous to pain and suffering. Even Turner acknowledges that a ‚Äúperfect match‚Äù to 18th-century claims isn‚Äôt required and that a ‚Äúsuitable analog‚Äù can suffice. Wrongful death damages are derivative of the underlying personal injury claim and include the same types of noneconomic losses, like loss of enjoyment of life.

In Bibbs v. Toyota, the Supreme Court confirmed this similarity: ‚Äúthe sorts of damages recoverable in wrongful death actions are substantially the same as the kinds of damages that may be recovered in personal injury actions.‚Äù

2Ô∏è‚É£ 1798 isn‚Äôt the only relevant date. Georgia‚Äôs 1868 Constitution, enacted after the state rejoined the Union after the Civil War, also guaranteed a right to trial by jury. By that time, wrongful death claims had existed in Georgia since 1850.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The statute isn‚Äôt severable. Because the cap is unconstitutional as applied to personal injury claims, courts cannot salvage the statute by severing the unconstitutional portion. Doing so would require rewriting the law, which is something only the legislature can do.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Equal protection. Capping damages only when the patient dies, but not when they survive with the same harm, creates an arbitrary and irrational distinction.

Ultimately, we‚Äôll have to see what Georgia‚Äôs appellate courts do with this. But if you handle medical malpractice cases in Georgia, there are still multiple reasons to believe the cap cannot apply to wrongful death claims either.",22,5,1,28,22.73,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_think-that-the-georgia-supreme-courts-june-activity-7359621603338383360-QJZf

With AI adoption accelerating and teams more distributed than ever, one question keeps surfacing in my conversations with operators, law firm partners, and service providers alike:

How do we design organisations that unlock‚Äînot erode‚Äîhuman potential?

Because here‚Äôs the paradox: 

Technology gives us unprecedented capability. But it doesn‚Äôt automatically give us clarity, connection, or culture.

The faster the world moves, the easier it is to lose sight of the people doing the work. That‚Äôs what I see most often in the PI space. Operational pressure keeps increasing. AR timelines stretch. Tech stacks grow. But morale? Alignment? Often moving in the opposite direction.

We can‚Äôt automate our way out of that. What we need is intentional leadership.
To me, that starts with three non-negotiables:

I. Lead with Purpose 
Every system we implement‚Äîwhether it's for billing, reimbursement, or AI-driven forecasting‚Äîneeds to serve a clear why. Not just ‚ÄúCan we build it?‚Äù but ‚ÄúShould we‚Äîand who does it serve?‚Äù

II. Build with People at the Center 
Efficiency matters. But so does experience. If your workflows are faster but leave teams confused, burnt out, or disconnected‚Äîyou‚Äôve just moved the pain upstream.

III. Create Performance That Actually Matters 
In too many firms, performance still means compliance and checking boxes. But the best organizations I‚Äôve seen? They invest in clarity. Feedback. Growth pathways. That‚Äôs how you turn good operators into great ones.

Technology will keep evolving. But the real shift‚Äîthe one that matters‚Äîis how we choose to use it.

The future of PI servicing, and frankly any professional services business, won‚Äôt be won by those who move fastest. It‚Äôll be won by those who move with the most intention.

We have the opportunity to build something better: systems that are not only more efficient, but more human. That‚Äôs not a pipe dream. It‚Äôs a leadership choice.

So the question is: Are we designing systems that just scale? Or are we building ones that help people thrive?",7,0,0,7,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidzeising_as-leaders-were-facing-an-inflection-pointnot-activity-7359229366192480256-iAxi

Yes, some tasks can be handled well by outsourced employees or contractors. But client-facing interactions, especially first impressions, are a different story.

I just read an article about a major hotel chain facing backlash for using a call center in India for their front desk check-ins. 

Customers were frustrated. It felt impersonal. There was no local connection. People thought the hotel was trying to save money by hiring cheaper overseas labor instead of local employees. And it damaged the brand.

There‚Äôs lessons here for law firm owners. 

The same thing can happen in a law firm. When someone reaches out to a lawyer, it‚Äôs because they have a problem. They want the problem solved. They want to be understood. They want to feel like someone in their corner is listening and can help.

If their first interaction feels scripted, impersonal, disconnected (ie the proverbial overseas call center experience), it sends the wrong message.

Can you cut corners by using an overseas call center, or even AI? In the short-term, yes.

I‚Äôm convinced some defense lawyers prep their clients this way to avoid anything damaging on the record, treating depositions like the final battleground because they‚Äôre preparing for settlement, not trial.

But they forget something critical:

Juries see through this.
And they don‚Äôt like it.

There‚Äôs two ways to handle this kind of witness. One is to get frustrated.

The better option is to lean in. Ask pointed questions. Draw out what they do remember, and contrast it with what they suddenly don‚Äôt. Expose the absurdity. Highlight what they obviously should know but claim they don‚Äôt. Send follow-up discovery to show their ""I don't know"" testimony is ridiculous.

Lack of knowledge obstructionism might avoid a sound bite at deposition, but it is often easy to unravel. And the lack of knowledge makes for devastating testimony at trial.",44,11,0,55,25.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darl-champion-georgia-injury-lawyer_ever-come-across-the-i-dont-know-or-i-activity-7358862306690146305-6xMf

Reid,reidzeising,team,7358142207813382148,2025-08-04 14:30:10.014,"Tort reform in Georgia just took a sharp turn‚Äîand it‚Äôs reshaping PI economics in real time.

With the passage of SB 68 and SB 69, we‚Äôre seeing a shift that mirrors tort reform playbooks in states like Florida and Texas.

At first glance, these rules may seem like procedural tweaks.

But if you‚Äôre a PI provider, attorney, or funder‚Äîthe impact is anything but minor.

Here‚Äôs the short version:

SB 68 ‚Äì The ‚ÄúReal-World Cost‚Äù Rule
Only actual payments can be counted toward damages.
Inflated medical bills? No longer admissible.
Seat Belt Use is Now Admissible
Affects comparative fault, especially in auto claims.
Anchoring Limits Introduced
Caps how attorneys present pain-and-suffering figures to juries.

SB 69 ‚Äì Mandatory Litigation Funding Disclosure
Any funding over $25K must be reported, regardless of source.

What does this mean?
- Leaner reimbursements
- Increased scrutiny on liens
- Reduced leverage at trial
- And a significant shift in how cases are financed and forecasted

Effective Jan 1, 2026. But here‚Äôs the kicker:

Cases filed today could still fall under these rules.

So if you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll worry about this later,‚Äù you may already be behind.

At Gain, we‚Äôve been tracking these changes for months. Not just to stay informed‚Äîbut to help our partners adapt their models before the rules go live.
The cost of waiting isn‚Äôt just operational. It‚Äôs strategic.

Are you seeing similar shifts in your state?
What adjustments are you making to your lien strategy or funding disclosures?

Eliezer,eliezer-nerenberg,team,7357055087401156608,2025-08-01 14:30:20.31,"Most PI firms treat liens like paperwork. Strategic firms treat them like assets.
There‚Äôs a big difference.

Aging reports tell you how long a claim‚Äôs been sitting.
But asset-minded CFOs are asking: When should it have been resolved?

That‚Äôs where things get interesting.

When you start scoring liens by recovery probability‚Äîbased on attorney behavior, legal stage, and documentation lag‚Äîyou move from reconciliation to revenue intelligence.

Here‚Äôs what that shift unlocks:

- Faster, more accurate cash forecasting
- Visibility into at-risk liens before they go stale.
- Fewer surprises at settlement.
- More leverage when working with underperforming attorneys or intake sources

It‚Äôs not about more data.
It‚Äôs about smarter signals:

- % of liens past maturity
- Docs still missing
- Recovery variance by provider
- Delay rates by attorney

At Gain, we‚Äôve helped firms make this shift‚Äîfrom static aging reports to dynamic recovery dashboards.
Because in PI, the question isn‚Äôt how much you‚Äôre owed.

It‚Äôs how much you‚Äôll actually recover‚Äîand when.
Let‚Äôs turn your lien book into a forecastable asset.

Please reach out to me if you want a lien performance audit or demo of our Recovery Intelligence dashboard.

Some greatest hits I‚Äôve heard:

üîπ ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt one person who knows about all this stuff.‚Äù
Great. Designate multiple people. That‚Äôs exactly what the rule allows.

üîπ ‚ÄúThe company doesn‚Äôt have any knowledge about some of these topics.‚Äù
Ok, then you still need to produce a witness who says, under oath, ‚ÄúThe company has no knowledge.‚Äù

üîπ ‚ÄúThe person I would designate was already deposed.‚Äù
That was as an individual. A 30(b)(6) deposition is different. If you want to designate them that‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôll need to depose them as the company rep. 

üîπ Witness: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any personal knowledge about this topic.‚Äù
That‚Äôs not good enough. The witness has an obligation to be prepared on the company‚Äôs knowledge, not just their own.

üîπ ‚ÄúObjection, that question isn‚Äôt within the scope of the topics.‚Äù
The topics don‚Äôt constrain what questions can be asked. The topics determine what the witness must be prepared to answer on behalf of the organization. Questions can go beyond the topics, though if they do there may be issues about whether the answers bind the organization.

Rule 30(b)(6) isn‚Äôt new. But too many lawyers treat it like it is. If you‚Äôre defending one, read the rule. Then read the cases.

You might know the metaphor.

In the classic HBR piece ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Got the Monkey?‚Äù, managers are warned about a hidden trap: when you casually agree to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù without assigning next steps, you‚Äôre not helping.

You‚Äôre adopting.

The monkey is no longer theirs. It‚Äôs yours.
And now you‚Äôre running a monkey sanctuary.

In PI operations, these monkeys look like:

‚Äì ‚ÄúJust let me know what you need to sign off.‚Äù
‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting on the lien doc. Can you send it again?‚Äù
‚Äì ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre chasing billing‚Äîcan you call the attorney?‚Äù

These sound like team collaboration.
But if you‚Äôre not careful, they quietly turn into backlogs.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

You can‚Äôt scale a PI business if every monkey ends up on your back, or desk.

You need rules:
‚Äì Every task has a clear owner
‚Äì Every handoff includes the next move
‚Äì Every ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help‚Äù ends with ‚Äúbut the task stays with you‚Äù

Reid,reidzeising,team,7356292496898859008,2025-07-30 12:00:04.566,"Most PI firm dashboards can tell you what‚Äôs outstanding.
But very few can tell you what‚Äôs recoverable.

And that‚Äôs a problem‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre a CFO trying to forecast cash flow in a system where payment timelines hinge on legal milestones, not invoice dates.

In my experience, most firms don‚Äôt have a lien problem.
They have a visibility problem.
Here‚Äôs what traditional AR reports miss:
- Which liens are quietly aging into unrecoverable territory?
- Where documentation lags are delaying recovery?
- Which attorneys, case types, or jurisdictions increase time-to-cash?
- Why ‚Äúquick-close‚Äù cases are actually lagging 30‚Äì40% behind forecast?

This isn‚Äôt just a reporting issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic one.
Because not all liens are equal.
Some are maturing fast.
Some are quietly going stale.

And unless you‚Äôre tracking maturity, legal progress, and document flow together‚Äîyou‚Äôre managing in the dark.
The fix?

1. Score liens by recovery probability.
2. Track expected maturity windows by case type.
3. Flag high-risk claims based on attorney behaviour or documentation gaps

Forecast recovery, not just balances
In PI, aging is linear‚Äîbut recovery isn‚Äôt.

If your finance team is stuck reconciling spreadsheets while revenue stalls, maybe it‚Äôs time to treat liens like what they really are: assets with risk, value, and timing that needs to be measured.

Drop a comment if you‚Äôd like the ‚ÄúLiens as Assets‚Äù guide I‚Äôve been sharing with finance teams lately.

But Georgia‚Äôs new bills‚ÄîSB 68 and SB 69‚Äîstand out for all the wrong reasons.
They were pitched as transparency measures.

Framed as steps toward fairness.

But in practice?

They make it significantly harder for injured patients to access care‚Äîand for providers to get paid.

The math is simple:

Fewer financial tools for patients

Greater administrative burden for providers

Reduced recovery potential for legal teams

For providers operating on thin margins, the risk just went up.

For plaintiffs, access to care just became more conditional.

And for everyone involved in PI, this shifts the landscape‚Äîquietly, but decisively.

This isn‚Äôt about theory.

It‚Äôs about real-world consequences that will start showing up in denied claims, delayed reimbursements, and discouraged providers.

For Providers: More administrative headaches, slower reimbursements, and potential delays in payments.

For Patients: Longer wait times for care, fewer financing options, and higher out-of-pocket costs.

For Attorneys: Increased complexity in lien disclosures, delayed payments, and new compliance risks.

How will these changes impact your practice, your patients, and your legal partners? It's time to review your lien documentation, educate your team, and prepare for the future.

Let's talk about how Gain Servicing can help streamline case management and ensure you're prepared for what‚Äôs coming.

Now? It‚Äôs just smart operations.

We tend to think innovation starts in big hospitals or national law firms.

Why? Because they don‚Äôt have the luxury of inefficiency.

When cash flow is tight and back-office teams are stretched, AI isn‚Äôt a nice-to-have. It‚Äôs the difference between burnout and breathing room.

I‚Äôve seen: 
‚Üí Clinics tracking lien reimbursements in real-time 
‚Üí PI providers cutting hours of weekly attorney follow-ups down to minutes 
‚Üí Back offices run by lean teams‚Äîbecause the system finally works for them, not the other way around

Here are three key strategies for physician leaders in orthopedic and PI-focused practices to maintain focus and energy‚Äîwithout sacrificing their well-being:

1. Prioritize like a CEO, think like a surgeon
 
Not every decision requires your full attention. Establish a decision-making framework that allows for quick, confident choices and delegate where possible.
 
2. Build a high-performing team
 
 Surround yourself with operational experts to handle everything from billing to case management. With the right support, you can focus on what matters most‚Äîyour patients and long-term strategy.
 
3. Protect your downtime like surgery time

Block off time in your calendar for recovery. Set clear boundaries and avoid the temptation to let work bleed into your off-hours. Just like your patients, you need time to recover to perform at your best.
 

Leading a practice doesn‚Äôt have to come at the cost of your health. By implementing the right systems and support, you can maintain a sustainable balance between leadership and patient care.

üëë The Visionary Warrior King

For Darius McDougle

He stands seven feet tall ‚Äî not just in height, but in heart.
A guardian of dreams, a soldier for justice, a monarch of movement.
His vision stretches beyond the skyline ‚Äî
charting paths where others see problems,
planting seeds where others see stone.


---

‚öîÔ∏è The Warrior in him fights ‚Äî not for glory,
but for growth, for equity, for legacy.
He builds systems, not silos.
He protects the broken and uplifts the bold.


---

üëë The King in him commands presence ‚Äî
not through fear, but through foundation.
He governs with grace, listens like a sage,
and leads like he was born for the throne.


---

üß† The Visionary in him imagines differently.
He doesn‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúWhat is?‚Äù ‚Äî he dares to ask ‚ÄúWhat could be?‚Äù
Marketing isn‚Äôt just a funnel; it‚Äôs a form of art.
Part science. Part spirit. All soul.


---

üåå The Sage in him knows that learning never ends.
Every meeting, every misstep, every mind he mentors ‚Äî
is part of the greater masterpiece he‚Äôs painting.


---

üíì And the Lover?
He‚Äôs emerging. Softening. Strengthening.
Balancing passion with peace, leadership with love.
Because even kings need somewhere to rest their crown.


---

He is a storm and a strategist.
A heart with armor.
A ruler of realms both digital and divine.


---

He is Darius.
The Visionary Warrior King.

It‚Äôs not about charisma. It‚Äôs about how others experience you‚Äîwhether your team trusts your thinking, whether a client feels calm in your presence, whether people lean in when you speak.

Over 15 years, I‚Äôve sat across from countless practice owners, law partners, and ops leaders. The ones who move the needle? They speak with clarity, lead with intention, and make decisions without panic.

They don‚Äôt raise their voice.
They raise the level of trust in the room.

If you‚Äôre building a team, managing crisis-level AR, or leading high-stakes conversations‚Äîpresence isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs leverage. And the good news?

It‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre born with. It‚Äôs something you build.

When I started Gain, I wasn‚Äôt just solving for cash flow,
I was solving for broken systems.

Because too many medical providers who treat personal injury patients aren‚Äôt just waiting on reimbursement‚Äîthey‚Äôre drowning in administrative sludge.

‚û°Ô∏è 43 emails to chase a lien.
‚û°Ô∏è 12 phone calls to confirm a case.
‚û°Ô∏è A full-time team just to decode state-specific statutes.

And that‚Äôs before we talk about underpayment risk.
It wasn‚Äôt just frustrating. It was costing providers real revenue.

I‚Äôve seen physicians turn away PI cases‚Äînot because they didn‚Äôt care, but because they couldn‚Äôt afford the paperwork.

It‚Äôs not about automation. It‚Äôs about orchestration.
So we built something different:

‚úÖ A smarter workflow engine that understands regulatory nuance.
‚úÖ A platform that translates legal and financial complexity into clarity.
‚úÖ A human team that works hand-in-hand with your back office.

Treating PI patients should be a revenue opportunity‚Äînot a regulatory liability.
And the ones who will win in this new PI landscape?

They‚Äôre not the ones who shout the loudest.
They‚Äôre the ones who operate the smartest.

But personal injury revenue? That‚Äôs a different beast.

Settlement-based income is notoriously unpredictable‚Äîdelays, reductions, and disputes can wreak havoc on your cash flow projections.

Here‚Äôs how top CFOs are gaining control:

1. Use Historical Collection Curves
Model PI revenue by analyzing historical settlement timelines and average collection rates per attorney.

2. Segment by Attorney Risk Profile
Not all legal partners pay the same. High-risk attorneys can tank your forecasts‚Äîtrack trends and build smarter assumptions.

3. Cash Flow Buffering is a Must
Build reserves for long-tail PI receivables and stagger spend around expected collections.

4. Leverage AI for Real-Time Visibility
Platforms like Gain offer predictive analytics for settlement timing, case aging, and attorney behavior‚Äîturning guesswork into financial clarity.

The result?
More predictable forecasting.
Stronger cash flow strategy.

I remember launching a new operational workflow for our provider partners. It looked great on a whiteboard. We rolled it out in record time. But within a week, it was clear‚Äîour clients were confused, and our internal teams weren‚Äôt aligned. We had optimized for launch, not adoption.

That was the turning point.

I learned that in healthcare, where the stakes involve real people and real lives‚Äîclarity trumps velocity. Implementation has to include context. Change has to come with communication. And leadership means knowing when to press forward and when to pause long enough to bring people with you.

Today, our approach at Gain still values urgency‚Äîbut it‚Äôs paired with intention. We build fast, but we roll out thoughtfully. We move quickly, but we never leave understanding behind.

If you‚Äôre scaling in a complex industry, here‚Äôs the lesson I‚Äôd offer:

The prior lawyer took the deposition of the treating doctor for use at trial and didn't use a single visual illustration or prop.

‚ùå No illustrations showing the injury.

‚ùå No illustrations showing the procedure to treat the injury.

‚ùå No anatomy diagrams showing the body parts injured.

‚ùå No anatomical models.

And to make matters worse, the doctor's testimony frequently used medical terms for the anatomy that a layperson wouldn't know.

The deposition was useless.

You have to show your client's injuries. You have to show the procedures. You have to use terms that the jury will understand. You have to get the doctor to explain medical jargon.

This seems simple, but I routinely see other lawyers who don't do this.

This is why we use all sorts of visual illustrations and anatomical models in our cases. 

No case is too small to use them in. Even if the most significant treatment was an epidural steroid injection, we're using an illustration of the procedure.

More automation. More templates. More workflows.
But none of it mattered when the attorney on the other end just‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt respond.

Or when the lien sat ignored for 18 months.
Or when the provider's revenue cycle got stuck in limbo‚Äîagain.

It wasn‚Äôt for lack of effort. We were doing the work. Chasing. Logging. Faxing.
But the truth hit: in PI, execution doesn‚Äôt matter if you're not aligned with strategy. That‚Äôs when we changed our playbook.

Instead of chasing documents, we started building trust at the top.

We developed a POV‚Äînot just on lien servicing, but on how providers could protect margin and scale LOP-based care sustainably.

Then we did something most servicing firms don‚Äôt:

We yo-yo‚Äôd up and down the chain.

‚Üí We met with law firm principals to understand their pressure points.
‚Üí Dropped into case managers' inboxes to map their operational bottlenecks.
‚Üí Then bounced back up with a shared roadmap: lower friction, faster resolution, better cash flow for both sides.

Now, providers weren‚Äôt just vendors. They were strategic partners.
And attorneys? They started bringing us into cases earlier‚Äîbecause we weren‚Äôt just helping them close files. We were helping them win. 

This isn‚Äôt about doing more. It‚Äôs about alignment and focusing on the right things. Because in the PI space, your leverage isn‚Äôt just your tech stack.

Reid,reidzeising,team,7344371476411654146,2025-06-27 14:30:11.8,"I once got laughed out of a room pitching medical lien financing to a national PI firm.

They said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how the system works.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù Back then, the lien process was a black box.

- Providers were flying blind on reimbursements
- Attorneys were juggling a dozen vendors for every case
- Patients were stuck in the middle

I saw an opportunity to fix the infrastructure no one else wanted to touch.

Not with hype. 
Not with big promises. 
But with operational discipline.

We built Gain to make third-party reimbursement more predictable, transparent, and scalable.

It meant getting deep into the weeds.

- Mapping workflows from intake to settlement.
- Analyzing reimbursement variances by case characteristics, county, and third-party liability carrier.
- Building models that forecast case value using years of medical and legal data.

It wasn‚Äôt flashy. But it worked.

Today, the same firms that laughed now forwards our reports to their CFOs.
Hospitals and healthcare providers call us for proactive forecasts.

And when legislation like Georgia SB 69 drops‚Äîwe‚Äôre the first call for impact modeling. This isn‚Äôt a story about revenge.

It‚Äôs about building what the market actually needs, even when no one‚Äôs asking for it yet.

The magic isn‚Äôt always in the idea.

It‚Äôs in sticking around long enough to prove it.

Yes to every lien.
Yes to every intake.
Yes to every case, no matter how complex.

And in this business, growth feels like survival.

But here‚Äôs what that ‚Äúyes‚Äù actually looked like:

‚úÖ Hours chasing paperwork across three firms
‚úÖ Revenue tied up in cases that went nowhere
‚úÖ Teams burned out trying to fix broken communication loops

I thought I was helping.
What I was really doing was hiding from harder decisions.

The turning point?

When we started building systems at Gain that let providers say a strategic no.

‚úÖ Not every case is worth taking.
‚úÖ Not every firm is worth working with.
‚úÖ Not every process is worth patching together with duct tape and goodwill.

We got them data that helped them ask questions like:
üëâ Is a case aligned with their strategic priorities?
üëâ Will the case resolve in a way that actually protects their revenue?
üëâ Is the firm structured for partnership‚Äîor chaos?

And most importantly:

Can they build the operational muscle to say ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a fit‚Äù?

Because saying no isn‚Äôt about being difficult.
It‚Äôs about being focused.

It‚Äôs about protecting the time, the revenue, and the sanity of your practice.

If you‚Äôre still saying yes to every ask, I promise you:

You‚Äôre not scaling.
You‚Äôre drowning in slow-motion.

The strategic no is what turns reactive practices into high-performance PI businesses.

I was burning out my people.

Every Monday: ""What's your pipeline? What's closing this week?"" Twenty minutes of robotic updates while people secretly checked their phones. They were there physically, but mentally planning their escape.

I thought I was being efficient. Really, I was sucking the life out of the one hour each week where I had everyone's attention.

Then my top performer pulled me aside: ""Eli, these meetings feel like interrogations. We're not a team - we're just individual salespeople reporting to you.""

That hit different.

So I changed everything. I started first with three rounds of box breathing to get people present. Then I stopped talking so much. I assigned ""black belts"" - team members who owned pipeline tracking, marketing, and product updates.

But here's what really transformed everything: I connected the dots to WHY we do this work.

At Gain, when we're working with healthcare providers in the PI space, it's not just about processing claims. It's about a car accident victim getting care without their provider drowning in paperwork. It's about that provider going home feeling accomplished instead of overwhelmed.

When your team understands they're changing lives, not just hitting numbers, everything shifts.

Most leaders think team meetings are about control and accountability. They're actually about connection and purpose.

Your team doesn't need another status update. They need to remember why their work matters. Because when people feel their impact, they don't just show up to meetings. They show up as leaders.",4,2,0,6,50.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_when-i-started-leading-teams-at-metlife-activity-7341869085539885058-9uNT

This isn‚Äôt a theoretical impact‚Äîit‚Äôs direct and measurable:

- Patients would delay or skip treatment.
- Capital markets would pull back, fast.

Litigation finance exists to make sure injured individuals can access care now, not months or years later. We shouldn‚Äôt be taxing that lifeline out of existence.

Years ago, I led an initiative to streamline personal injury claim processing for a network of providers. On paper, the system was airtight: efficient intake, precise documentation, faster LOP settlements.

But over time, I noticed a growing frustration on the clinical side. Physicians were spending more time justifying claims than focusing on care. Staff morale was slipping. And worst of all, patients were starting to feel like case files instead of people.

I had optimized the process but lost sight of the experience.

A provider finally said to me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delivering care with one hand tied behind our back.‚Äù That was the turning point.

From that moment forward, I started building with a new lens: operations should serve the mission, not just the metrics.

Today at Gain, our systems do more than manage third-party claims‚Äîthey protect the bandwidth of healthcare professionals so they can focus on what matters most: patient care.

In leadership, we often chase efficiency. But the real question is‚Äîefficient for whom?

If you‚Äôre treating PI patients, waiting months to get reimbursed, or worried about new laws getting passed‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone.

But there is a way forward. And it starts by recognizing that automation isn‚Äôt enough. We need smarter systems, strategic partnerships, and policy clarity.

In his latest article, Gain CEO Reid Zeising examines how legislation like this‚Äîcombined with rising administrative overhead‚Äîis clogging the system with what economists now call sludge.

It‚Äôs easy to take an old complaint or discovery request and reuse it as a template. Everyone does it. But if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre missing the most important part of your development.

And with AI tools that are becoming more prevalent, there is an even greater risk of lawyers overly relying on tools without doing the necessary critical thinking. 

You‚Äôre not a secretary. You‚Äôre not a document processor. 

You‚Äôre an advocate. A strategist. A problem-solver.

Every phrase, every count, every word you put in a pleading or discovery request matters. And if you don‚Äôt understand why something is there, you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice.

Understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is how you grow.
 
Why did we plead that count?

Why did we phrase the interrogatory that way?

Why did we request these documents for this time period?

Why did we include this topic in our 30(b)(6) notice?

Knowing the answer to those questions is what separates the lawyers who advance quickly from those who stay dependent on others to think for them.

It‚Äôs a cash flow problem hiding in plain sight across thousands of personal injury cases.

Providers deliver care upfront‚ÄîMRIs, surgery, physical therapy‚Äîbased on trust in the PI process. But too often, settlement timelines stretch far beyond expectation.

‚ùå Settlement delays
‚ùå Unclear lien status
‚ùå Lack of payment transparency

And it‚Äôs not just frustrating‚Äîit‚Äôs financially devastating for clinics with small margins and high fixed costs.

At Gain se, we‚Äôve spent years mapping these financial choke points. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned:

‚úîÔ∏è Transparency in case progress reduces friction at disbursement
‚úîÔ∏è Predictable payment schedules build stronger provider-attorney relationships
‚úîÔ∏è Accelerated funding options help providers avoid write-offs and retain capacity for the next case

There‚Äôs a better way to handle PI reimbursement‚Äîand it starts with designing the system around the realities of medical cash flow.

I was wrong.

We'd onboard a multi-specialty practice, celebrate the annual agreement, and pat ourselves on the back. Meanwhile, that same practice would process maybe 20% of their PI cases through our system. 

The rest? Still handled the old way - manually, inefficiently, burning out their staff.

I'd look at our revenue numbers and think we were crushing it... The invoices were getting paid. The renewals were happening. But something felt off.

Then came the wake-up calls. Three practices in one quarter didn't renew. All three had ""looked great on paper"" - paying customers for 18+ months. But when I dug deeper, the truth hit me like a freight train:

They never actually integrated our workflows. They were paying us to sit on the sidelines while they struggled with the same operational chaos that made them call us in the first place.

I recently reviewed a case file from an imaging center that involved a simple MRI for a personal injury patient.

From initial service to final payment required:

‚úÖ 47 emails between the provider and attorney
‚úÖ 12 phone calls
‚úÖ 4 faxed document packages
‚úÖ 3 different contact people on each side

This level of administrative friction isn't unusual in PI cases‚Äîit's the norm.

The fundamental problem? Medical and legal workflows were not designed to interface efficiently.

Providers who excel in managing third-party liability claims have built operational bridges between these systems:

‚úÖ Clear lines of communication
‚úÖ Designated points of contact
‚úÖ Shared visibility into case progression
‚úÖ Standardized documentation protocols

This isn't about providers becoming legal experts or attorneys becoming medical specialists‚Äîit's about creating aligned operational frameworks that acknowledge the unique nature of the medical-legal interface.

How much administrative overhead is your current PI communication process generating?

I hear this complaint from medical providers constantly, usually followed by frustration about lost revenue and wasted administrative time.

But when I speak with PI attorneys, I hear a different perspective:

""We notified the provider's billing department. It's not our fault if they don't have internal systems to track that information.""

This communication breakdown costs both sides dearly‚Äîdelaying case resolutions, straining professional relationships, and creating unnecessary administrative burden.

The most successful provider-attorney partnerships I've observed have implemented:

‚úÖ Shared visibility systems for case status
‚úÖ Clear communication protocols
‚úÖ Standardized documentation requirements
‚úÖ Defined roles and responsibilities

When medical and legal teams operate with aligned processes, both sides win‚Äîfaster settlements, reduced administrative costs, and better client/patient outcomes.

That's what the CFO of a major orthopedic group told me last week.
When I asked how they calculated that figure, he shrugged. ""That's just our best guess.""

After analyzing their data, we discovered the reality was nearly double their estimate.

This isn't unusual.

Most healthcare organizations treating personal injury patients lack the specialized analytics to truly understand their performance.

The data blind spots typically include:

‚úÖ Geographic settlement trends
‚úÖ Settlement success rates by attorney
‚úÖ Average time-to-payment by case type
‚úÖ Write-off patterns across different injury categories

Without these insights, providers are essentially flying blind‚Äîmaking critical business decisions based on gut feeling rather than evidence.

The most successful practices in the PI space have recognized that standard healthcare analytics don't capture the unique dynamics of third-party liability claims.

They've implemented specialized reporting systems that track attorney performance, predict settlement timelines, and identify optimization opportunities throughout the medical-legal process.

The result? Dramatically improved collections and reduced administrative burden.

Just months after Georgia passed its most sweeping tort reform in 20 years, a defense lawyer is back on LinkedIn pushing for even more.

Of course, I had to hear about it through screenshots because this particular defense lawyer has me blocked. Apparently, surrounding yourself with an echo chamber is easier than defending those absurd ideas in an open forum.

Here‚Äôs my response to his ‚Äúreform wish list‚Äù:

üõë Cap contingency fees?

So injured people should get less justice if they win more money? Contingency fees are how ordinary folks afford representation.

Also, how is capping contingency fees going to ""realign incentives""? If you think large jury asks are driven by lawyers wanting to earn more money, wouldn't putting a cap on the percentage cause them to ask for even more money?

And if we're talking about re-aligning incentives, what about the incentives your firm has to bill the hell out of cases to run up attorneys' fees instead of settling them efficiently?

üõë Repeal the collateral source rule?

Hasn't that essentially been done with the latest bill that was passed? Now, defendants get to introduce the lower amount that health insurance actually paid.

Regardless, why should a negligent party benefit just because the plaintiff had insurance? So the defendant gets a discount because somebody spent years paying for insurance? Should a widow get less when a drunk driver kills her husband because they spent years paying premiums for a million-dollar life insurance policy?

üõë Gatekeeping $10M+ damage asks?

You don‚Äôt need ‚Äúgatekeeping‚Äù when a jury of twelve already gets to decide if a claim is valid. If you think no one deserves $10M, you clearly haven‚Äôt spent time with a parent who lost a child, a wife who lost her husband, or a client paralyzed by someone else's carelessness.

üõë Litigation funding transparency?

Weird how we never hear calls for a disclosure showing that insurance companies are really the ones behind a case, or how much they‚Äôve spent to deny and delay claims. Or how much money certain experts have made from specific insurance companies. I see State Farm using the same experts repeatedly. Do we get to introduce how much they made from State Farm?

üõë Limit depositions and non-party discovery?

Translation: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want you finding out what really happened.‚Äù

These aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù proposals. They‚Äôre part of a coordinated campaign to restrict access to justice, weaken plaintiffs‚Äô rights, and insulate bad actors from accountability.

After 15 years working at the intersection of healthcare and legal services, I've noticed something fascinating:

Providers and attorneys each blame the other for the friction in personal injury cases‚Äîyet rarely communicate directly about improving the process.
The attorneys I speak with express frustration about:

‚úÖ Inconsistent medical documentation
‚úÖ Delayed response to records requests
‚úÖ Last-minute billing surprises
‚úÖ Difficulty coordinating with provider offices

Meanwhile, providers complain about:

‚úÖ Settlement notification delays
‚úÖ Poor communication during case progression
‚úÖ Unclear documentation requirements
‚úÖ Reduction requests without context

The most successful partnerships I've seen have established clear operational frameworks that address both sides' concerns.

This isn't just about better communication‚Äîit's about creating structured systems that align medical and legal workflows.

The result? Faster settlements, reduced administrative burden, and better outcomes for the patients/clients both sides serve.

What operational improvements would strengthen your provider-attorney relationships?

It was going on 12 months after I had started my own law firm. It was me and a paralegal. 

I didn't have a lot of work, but I was ready to move out of the two offices I was subleasing from a family law attorney in a high-rise. 

This space I ended up leasing was about 1000 square feet. It was 2 offices, a conference room, and a small reception area.

The move was short-sighted. How long did I really think I'd be able to stay in a place with just 2 offices and a reception area? 

After about 6 months at this new space, I had outgrown it. It was time to move across the hall to a bigger space where I stayed for the next four years.

It's surreal to look back at how much things have changed. For the last five years, I have been in my own 11,000 square foot building that I purchased in 2020.

If anybody tells you that you can quickly build and scale a law firm overnight, that you can 10x your firm in 6 months, that there is some secret sauce to getting cases, or whatever bullshit people are selling these days, they are lying to you.

It takes hard work performed consistently over time...a long time. 

Our instant gratification society will try to sell you on shortcuts. Don't fall for it. 

Focus on doing the work. That means showing up each and every day, being the best lawyer you can be, and building relationships and your brand.

For too long, we've accepted a system where:

‚úÖ Patients struggle to access care despite legitimate injuries
‚úÖ Providers wait years for reimbursement
‚úÖ Attorneys spend more time managing medical issues than legal ones
‚úÖ Insurance companies delay settlements by design

And everyone loses except the insurance companies.

The solution isn't Band-Aids‚Äîit's reimagining how this entire ecosystem functions.

That starts with technology that creates transparency between providers and attorneys. It continues with structured servicing that replaces manual spreadsheets and missed payments. And it culminates in AI-driven solutions that predict settlement timelines and optimize cash flow.

I founded Gain because I believe injured patients deserve access to quality healthcare, regardless of their insurance status or economic situation.

But delivering on that vision requires more than good intentions‚Äîit demands sophisticated systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface.

At a conference last month, I asked a group of revenue cycle directors: ""What's your average collection period for PI cases vs. standard insurance?""

Most couldn't answer specifically for PI cases‚Äîthey were tracking them alongside other receivables.

This blind spot creates major financial implications:

‚úÖ Cash flow forecasting errors
‚úÖ Inaccurate aging assumptions
‚úÖ Misallocated collection resources
‚úÖ Understated write-off risks

Traditional RCM systems weren't designed for the unique dynamics of third-party liability claims, where payment timelines are driven by legal processes rather than insurance adjudication.

The most sophisticated healthcare organizations have implemented specialized operational frameworks that complement their standard RCM processes, giving them visibility into:

‚úÖ Case-specific settlement tracking
‚úÖ Attorney relationship management
‚úÖ Documentation completion status
‚úÖ LOP/lien management

The result? More accurate financial projections, improved cash flow, and dramatically reduced write-offs.

If you handle cases in both state and federal courts, you're likely drowning in a sea of procedural rules, electronic filing requirements, and standing orders, some of which are 20, 30, even 40 pages long.

In state court, we have the Civil Practice Act and the Uniform Superior/State Court Rules. On top of that, an increasing number of judges are issuing highly detailed standing orders of their own.

Federal court isn't any simpler. You've got the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, district-specific local rules, and then each judge's individual standing orders, many of which are mini-novels on every conceivable procedural nuance.

This statement from a spine surgeon perfectly captures why so many medical providers struggle with personal injury cases.

It represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the medical-legal interface.
The reality? When providers take a passive role in third-party liability claim management, they experience:

‚úÖ Longer payment cycles (average 8-14 months)
‚úÖ Higher write-off rates (typically 15-30%)
‚úÖ Increased administrative burden chasing updates
‚úÖ Unpredictable cash flow and revenue forecasting

The most successful practices in the PI space take ownership of the entire process by implementing specialized servicing systems‚Äîmaintaining critical visibility without creating administrative nightmares.

These providers aren't trying to do attorneys' jobs. They're implementing operational frameworks that create alignment between medical care and legal processes.

At Gain, our AI-driven platform bridges this gap by automating case tracking, streamlining settlement visibility, and optimizing the entire revenue cycle for personal injury claims.

The result? Shorter payment cycles, lower write-offs, and dramatically improved profitability‚Äîwithout the administrative headache.

How actively does your practice manage the medical-legal interface in PI cases?

What doesn‚Äôt change?

‚úÖ Doing great work
‚úÖ Building real relationships
‚úÖ Being authentic
‚úÖ Showing up for your clients and community

Reid,reidzeising,team,7330964883527659522,2025-05-21 14:37:10.974,"Georgia's SB68 just made it dramatically more dangerous for healthcare providers to treat personal injury patients.

By eliminating collateral source protections, this legislation allows insurance companies to argue that providers should only be paid at Medicare or Medicaid rates‚Äîeven for patients who were never on these programs.

Let's be clear about what this means:

When a doctor treats an uninsured accident victim on a Letter of Protection, they're taking significant financial risk. They provide care now, trusting they'll be paid fairly when the case settles‚Äîwhich could take years.

SB68 dramatically increases that risk by allowing insurers to cherry-pick the lowest possible reimbursement rates as ""evidence"" of what's reasonable, regardless of the actual market rate for those services.

The result? 

Many providers will simply stop accepting PI patients altogether.

At Gain, we've built infrastructure specifically designed to help providers navigate this challenging landscape‚Äîwith data-driven approaches, risk management tools, and compliant servicing solutions that protect both providers and patients.

Because when providers can't afford to treat injured patients, it's not insurance companies who suffer‚Äîit's the patients themselves.

What other recent legislation have you seen affecting healthcare access for PI patients?

After analyzing hundreds of medical practices' performance in the personal injury space, I've identified a counterintuitive pattern:

The financial success of a PI practice has less to do with case volume or reimbursement rates than with one critical factor: operational design.

I recently compared two imaging centers with nearly identical:

‚úÖ Equipment and technology
‚úÖ Geographic markets
‚úÖ Reimbursement agreements
‚úÖ PI case volume

Yet one was thriving while the other considered abandoning personal injury cases entirely.

The difference? 

Their operational approach to the medical-legal interface. The struggling practice used traditional RCM systems for PI cases. The successful one had implemented specialized servicing solutions designed specifically for third-party liability claims.

In our analysis at Gain, we've observed that practices with specialized PI servicing solutions typically achieve higher collection rates and significantly faster settlement times compared to those using traditional RCM systems for PI cases.

At Gain, we've built our AI-driven platform precisely for this purpose‚Äîto transform how healthcare providers manage the complex PI revenue cycle, bridging the gap between medical care and legal processes.

In the PI space, your systems determine your success more than any other factor. The right operational framework doesn't just improve collections‚Äîit fundamentally changes the economics of personal injury cases for your practice.

What specialized operational solutions has your practice implemented for third-party liability claims? Are you ready to see how the right technology can transform your PI revenue?

1) Your ""higher reimbursement rates"" are mostly a mirage if you're tracking PI cases on spreadsheets. The administrative burden, delayed payments, and inevitable write-offs are consuming those margins.

2) Insurance companies aren't just randomly difficult‚Äîthey're strategically difficult. Their tactics are designed to force settlements by exhausting everyone involved, including medical providers.

3) The practices that thrive in the PI space don't just treat differently‚Äîthey operate differently. They've built systems specifically engineered for the medical-legal interface.

After spending years in this industry, I've watched countless healthcare providers enter the PI space attracted by higher reimbursement rates, only to retreat when the operational complexity overwhelms their standard workflows.

The providers who succeed have embraced specialized technology, third-party servicing partnerships, and medical-legal communication protocols that align with how PI cases actually progress.

The good news? These challenges are solvable. The providers who tackle them aren't just surviving in the PI space‚Äîthey're thriving, with collection rates 25-30% higher than those using traditional RCM approaches.

About 13 years ago, I was working at a plaintiff's firm. A lawyer called with this case. The client was in prison serving a very long sentence for various drug crimes after he was shot. He mostly recovered from his injuries. 

The case didn't have much upside. But it sounded interesting. 

I didn't know it then, but the decision to take the case was one of the most important decisions of my career.

The lawyer who referred me the case became a good friend and one of my most trusted referral sources. 

I was able to leave and start my own firm because of some of the cases he subsequently referred to me.

Since starting my firm, the cases he has referred me have produced multiple six- and seven-figure results, and even one eight-figure result. 

The lesson? You can‚Äôt always evaluate a case by the numbers in front of you. That one five-figure case turned into the foundation of a lot of what I‚Äôve built since.

That doesn't mean you should take every case that walks in the door. That‚Äôs not sustainable.

Before I was a lawyer, I was a bounce house expert.

For six years, I worked at a True Value Hardware Store in Fayetteville, NC during high school and college. It had an equipment rental division that included everything from power tools, paint sprayers, and lawn equipment, to inflatable slides, bounce houses, and huge party tents.

I set up bounce houses and party equipment at churches, backyards, schools, community centers, weddings, you name it. 

This was often done in the blistering heat of an Eastern North Carolina summer. We‚Äôre talking 100 degrees. 100% humidity. Sometimes half a dozen setups and takedowns in a day, all by myself.

I learned how to haul and anchor heavy equipment, clean inflatables at the end of long days, and somehow fold a giant, bounce house into a canvas bag that seemed two sizes too small.

At the time, it just felt like a job.

But looking back, I realize I learned some of the most valuable lessons of my life. Lessons about hard work, reliability and dependability, how to work with others from different walks of life, and how to talk to people.

Maybe this kind of marketing will produce enough volume that the law firm will find a needle in the haystack that is actually a good case. But it will not produce consistently good cases with good clients.

Why not? Because the best clients aren't people who view their car wreck like it is a lottery ticket.

They saw not just who the world saw, but the child they once held in their arms, full of hope, full of life.

I had zero problem giving them more time to answer and didn't even think twice about it.

Why?

1. They reached out to me prior to that and were not a-holes. (I still would have given them more time if they were jerks, but it helped that they were pleasant and professional).

2. They clearly demonstrated an intent to defend the case--i.e. it is not like they were intentionally dilatory.

3. The judge would have given them more time anyways and not held them in default.

4. I do have an obligation to my client, but I'm not going to try to make life harder for an attorney who made a simple mistake that will have a 99% chance of being corrected anyways. All it would do is mess up his relationship with his client and make his life miserable. And for what?

Litigation is adversarial by nature but it doesn't mean you have to be a jerk or be difficult for the sake of being difficult. 

And yet, some lawyers engage in needless procedural gamesmanship and make everyone's lives unnecessarily difficult. Maybe it is because they aren't actually good on the substance or maybe they just have sensitive egos and need to act that way to feel better about themselves. 

You can still be a zealous advocate for your client and show some grace to another attorney in a situation like this, even if they're on the other side.

This statement from a pain management practice owner perfectly captures the operational paradox I see constantly in the medical-legal space.

They're drowning in administrative work tracking third-party liability claims, yet ""too busy"" to implement systems that would eliminate that very burden.

It's like being too busy bailing water to patch the hole in your boat.

The reality is that practices in the PI space face a critical choice:

‚úÖ Continue the cycle of reactive, manual processes that consume staff time and create unpredictable cash flow.

‚úÖ Invest in specialized servicing systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface

One approach perpetuates the operational chaos. The other transforms PI cases from administrative headaches into predictable, profitable revenue streams.

The most successful practices I work with chose the second path and never looked back.

What's stopping your practice from optimizing its approach to third-party liability claims?

Last month, I sat down with the partners of a busy orthopaedic group. On paper, they were crushing it‚Äî27% growth year over year and expanding their PI caseload.

But something wasn't adding up in their finances.
I asked three simple questions:

1.- What does your average case settled for?
2.- Once you factor in bad debt, what does that number drop to?
3.- What is your total average of monthly Billable receivables specific to PI?

You'll be shocked to know how many Doctors or Practice Managers do not have these answers.

After 15 years in this business every doctor makes the same exact mistake, they think because their last case or cases settled at 60% of bill charges that means that's what they are averaging, and they couldn't be more wrong. 

Once you factor in the bad debit it on averages drops their percentages by almost 15-20 % and that's precisely where we step in and can help.

This is just one example of many of a practice that had invested millions in cutting-edge medical technology and clinical training but were using the same administrative processes for PI cases as they did in 2005.

After implementing our specialized operational systems for third-party liability claims, they were on the way for a brighter future.

The lesson? Don‚Äôt just settle, Gain.

That's the question I asked a neurosurgery practice CEO last week. His response? A frustrated laugh.

""I have absolutely no idea. My staff spends hours every week trying to figure that out.""

This practice generates over $5 million annually from personal injury cases. Yet they track these valuable assets using spreadsheets, sticky notes, and heroic efforts from an overwhelmed billing team.

It's a scenario I've seen hundreds of times across specialties:

‚úÖ Advanced systems for insurance billing
‚úÖ Sophisticated clinical protocols for patient care
‚úÖ State-of-the-art medical equipment throughout the facility

But when it comes to managing third-party liability claims? Stone Age approaches.

The most successful practices in the PI space have recognized that the medical-legal interface requires specialized operational systems‚Äînot just modified insurance billing processes.

The result? Complete visibility, predictable cash flow, and dramatically improved collections.

‚úÖ If we lose, we eat the costs and don't get paid for all the time we spent.

The reality is owning a personal injury law firm is not easy. There‚Äôs nothing guaranteed about this work. And if it was so easy, everyone would do it.

The fees we earn? They aren‚Äôt windfalls. They reflect the years of effort, risk, and resources that go into building the case, and the fact that we only get paid if we win. Contingency fees make justice accessible. Without them, most injured people couldn‚Äôt afford to pursue a claim at all.

This operational disconnect typically costs practices between $350-750K annually through:

‚úÖ Lost time chasing settlement status
‚úÖ Preventable write-offs from documentation gaps
‚úÖ Reduced collections from inefficient attorney coordination

When legislation is built on a fundamental misunderstanding, the fallout can be real‚Äîand in this case, it threatens access to justice for the people who need it most.
¬†
In my latest article, I break down how Georgia‚Äôs SB 69 conflates two very different industries and risks cutting off a vital lifeline for injured plaintiffs trying to stay afloat.

Because when regulation lacks nuance, the people who lose the most are the ones who can least afford it.

For me, it‚Äôs actually pretty simple: Let people work from wherever they‚Äôre more productive and creative.

I‚Äôve been working from home for 13 years now‚Äînot because it was trendy, but because I had to.

When I left Venezuela and moved to Colombia, things weren‚Äôt exactly smooth. I arrived with CADIVI and a student visa, which meant I couldn‚Äôt work for a Colombian company. So I started looking for another way‚Äîand found Elance (now UpWork). That changed my life.

Suddenly I could work on my own terms, manage my strange schedule, and‚Äîas an (at the time) undiagnosed neurodivergent that was dealing with a profound migratory grief ‚Äîcreate my own rhythm. Some days I needed to stay in pajamas and assign all of my resources to my projects. That didn‚Äôt make the work any less serious. My job was still front and center. Not my clothes. Not my messy hair. And for the first time, my career felt truly exciting and sustainable.

Not long after, I founded my first agency, DOGMA. We were fully remote‚Äîthis was 2013, way before it was common. We figured it out. I learned quickly: some people need structure and frequent check-ins. Others do their best when they‚Äôre trusted and left alone.

Later, when we merged with a sister agency in Venezuela, we were able to offer both options. Office? Great. Home? Also great. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

This isn‚Äôt about being right.

It‚Äôs about helping our teams thrive‚Äîin whatever environment helps them do their best work.

There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all. 

There's never a one-size-fits-all.",28,1,1,30,3.57,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nita-morales_that-working-from-home-vs-in-office-convo-activity-7316140010615812099-r6G_

- Raising barriers for victims
- Limiting access to compensation
- Making it harder to hold negligent parties accountable

While I agree that frivolous lawsuits should be minimized, we must ensure that the system remains fair, efficient, and centered on justice. That means:

- Speeding up compensation for victims
- Creating a legal process that is accessible to all
- Ensuring accountability for negligence, no matter who is responsible

For context, historically the Collateral Source Rule has prevented defendants from reducing their liability by pointing to compensation plaintiffs may have received from other sources. This rule ensures that plaintiffs are fully compensated for their injuries, regardless of any payments from their insurance or other sources.

Proponents of SB68 argue that these changes will enhance transparency in the legal process. But critics like me are concerned that allowing juries to consider these reimbursements could lead to reduced compensation for plaintiffs. In fact, it might discourage healthcare providers from treating injured patients at all, particularly those who are uninsured or underinsured, thereby limiting access to necessary medical care for vulnerable populations.

It‚Äôs also worth noting again that the proposed legislation includes provisions that could affect the calculation of noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering. Specifically, SB68 seeks to restrict how attorneys can argue for noneconomic damages, undoubtedly leading to less predictable and lower compensation for plaintiffs.

Do not ignore this important debate. There are implications for all of us.",25,1,2,28,4.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidzeising_as-we-continue-to-update-on-sb68-here-in-activity-7308938378375233536-72bL

Fortunately, there are a multitude of ways this can be done. Among the best options are those that quickly expand your patient base to bring in more cash flow, and those that help you grow without becoming overwhelmed. 

There are a lot of accidents and injuries that occur every day, culminating in between 300,000 and 500,000 personal injury claims being filed every year. Plaintiffs in personal injury cases need quality medical providers who will work with them and their attorneys. 

Getting your practice in front of personal injury attorneys is essential to reaching these patients. That‚Äôs where Gain can help. Our platform features your practice on the Gain Provider Map, a trusted resource attorneys use to find providers based on their clients‚Äô location and needs.

¬†
American for Patient Access (APA): Their purpose is to promote and expand access for uninsured and under-insured patients to immediate medical care and to aid medical providers in offering their services to as many patients as possible, regardless of their payor source.¬†
¬†
Join and donate here: https://lnkd.in/eFMSdg_s ¬†
¬†
The HealthWell Foundation: They help those in need overcome financial barriers to receiving high-quality healthcare. Their grants can assist in covering the costs of prescription copays, surgery, and pediatric care. Since their founding in 2003, they have issued over one million grants worth over $2.7 billion to help an estimated 727,000 patients.¬†¬†
¬†
Donate here: https://lnkd.in/eznT_eWd¬†¬†
¬†
Undue Medical Debt: Medical debt is a crushing burden for millions of Americans, who are often unable to catch up on their unpaid bills on their own. Undue Medical Debt has a transformative impact on patients‚Äô lives by erasing their debt. The charity uses donations to purchase medical debt for pennies on the dollar.¬†¬†
¬†
For more information: https://lnkd.in/ewhCeMn6¬†¬†
¬†
Help Hope Live: The site started out as a foundation established by a transplant surgeon and his wife, who is a nurse, to help end-stage heart disease patients who had been denied insurance pay for transplants. In the 2000s they expanded their mission to include personal injury patients. In 2019, they marked their 35th anniversary, after having raised $135 million.¬†¬†
¬†
On their site, you can either donate to the organization itself, or to one of their many individual crowdfunding campaigns.¬†¬†¬†
¬†
Donate here: https://lnkd.in/ekNxEbef¬†¬†

Please feel free to reach out to me with any charities that you believe are worth highlighting.¬†

Sometimes when people come back saying that they miss you, they're confessing that they've discovered that no one can love them the way you did. 

They once took you for granted and treated your love like a common thing. Then they tried replacing you, and they were shocked at how impossible it was.

Now they're crawling back, hoping you're still stuck where they left you and you're desperate enough to allow them back.

Whenever people return, always remember how they left.

The way someone treats you when they no longer need you is a true reflection of how much they respect you.

When you feel like you miss that connection, just remember the disrespect. 

You may not have moved on to another person, but you have moved onto something more important. That‚Äôs self-respect!!

Just because you're not with someone doesn't mean you're still vacant. 

You're a complete person by yourself, and you have the right to take your time to heal and regroup.

If someone else has been flipping one relationship after another, it just shows how uncomfortable they are by themselves. 

If they need so much support just to face existence, they have a deeper problem. 

Never become the plug-in when someone has failed at replacing you.

They will never value you, and their resentment towards you will multiply because, in a sense, you'll have beaten them. 

They will continue looking while still with you. You‚Äôre basically a placeholder. Eventually, they'll leave you for people who don't challenge them to change or grow.

In short, it's also self care when you shut your doors to inconsistent people. You may have a history with them, but when they prove themselves unworthy of where you're going, it's a wrap.

Sometimes your feelings can't think and you have to think for them.

Reid,reidzeising,team,7263231045162917889,2024-11-15 16:47:05.474,"Healthcare providers are navigating complex financial pressures, where the challenge isn‚Äôt just about salaries‚Äîit‚Äôs about sustainability. As Preston Alexander insightfully points out in his recent post, declining reimbursements impact the very existence of private practices, where overhead costs often outweigh revenue. 

In light of these hurdles, accepting medical liens has become a powerful, alternative, premium reimbursement source.  

By accepting personal injury patients on lien, practices can access new revenue streams that can enhance traditional reimbursements. Patients with Letters of Protection (LOPs) offer providers the opportunity to be compensated from settlement proceeds, often yielding higher payments compared to standard insurance reimbursements.

Reid,reidzeising,team,7262492609078607872,2024-11-13 15:52:47.797,"Few places bring the future into focus quite like the YPO‚Äôs first-ever Global Business Summit in Dubai‚Äîwhere over 1,000 leaders gathered to discuss strategies and innovations for driving positive change.¬† 

I had the privilege of attending the #YPOGBS24 and the energy there was unmatched. It‚Äôs rewarding to witness how our network continuously pushes the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in leadership and innovation.¬† 

The United Arab Emirates‚Äô commitment to advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) was evident throughout the summit. Appointing Omar Sultan AlOlama as the world‚Äôs first Minister of State for AI in 2017 shows just how serious they are about shaping the future. He put it best when he said, ‚ÄúOur secret to success is viewing problems and challenges as opportunities for growth.‚Äù He described so well that the US are Innovators, the European‚Äôs Regulators, the Chinese Imitators and he wants the UAE to be the Accelerators, investing in a non-exclusive manner in emerging technology leaders to further accelerate innovation. This mindset resonates with what we aim for at Gain, where we‚Äôre using technology to tackle the complex world of personal injury, making it simpler, faster, and better for everyone involved.¬† 

Another standout moment for me was the discussions on healthcare innovation and emerging AI applications‚Äîboth critical areas for us at Gain, where we innovate to ensure personal injury patients receive the care and support they deserve. 

Grateful to YPO for another inspiring event and excited to carry this energy back to Gain as we continue to drive change for our industry. It was wonderful to reunite with old friends and build new connections. Thank you to Sofyan Almoayed and the entire team for making this event unforgettable.¬† 

If you attended or have thoughts on the potential of innovation in healthcare, I‚Äôd love to connect. How do you see technology making a difference in both the healthcare and legal industries? Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going.

Reid,reidzeising,team,7259302548187045888,2024-11-04 20:36:38.807,"The future is now in healthcare. 

On my way to the Becker's Healthcare Annual ASC Meeting, I sat next to someone wearing a Meta Oculus on the plane and it got me thinking about the power of innovation‚Äîhow technology continues to shape our lives, especially in healthcare. The possibilities are endless! 

This year's Becker's event was phenomenal‚Äîfilled with insightful conversations, valuable takeaways, and some of the best networking opportunities. Hearing from visionary leaders like Nader Samii, Executive Chairman of nimble solutions, and outstanding athlete Caitlin Clark was inspiring. Caitlin‚Äôs dedication and resilience resonate with what it takes to drive healthcare forward. 

Thank you to my friend Scott Becker and his entire team for organizing such an impactful event. From connecting with partners to meeting so many passionate professionals, this experience was unforgettable. 

Similar to the Meta Oculus, the Gain platform utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive growth, helping ASC owners and physicians predict case values and increase reimbursements from Letters of Protection (LOPs). This aligns with our mission to ensure that everyone who has been injured through no fault of their own have access to the quality healthcare they deserve.

On behalf of the Gain team, a big thank you to all the ASC owners and healthcare professionals we met‚Äîand to those we missed, we‚Äôre looking forward to connecting soon. Please reach out for a portal demonstration or to schedule a meeting with me through the link below, I promise to always make time.

At Gain, we believe in simplifying the management of personal injury cases, providing ASCs with a vital source of reimbursement and ensuring greater access to care for those in need. It's alarming to consider that 100 million Americans, 30 million of whom are uninsured, have less than four weeks of savings. For those injured through no fault of their own, access to quality care becomes a significant challenge. 

Serving personal injury patients on lien not only fulfills a moral obligation but also represents a premium reimbursement source for ASCs. It's a strategy that can help counter the declining reimbursements we're seeing across the board. It's about doing the right thing for personal injury patients and our healthcare system.¬†

While it seems commonsense, Christine Porath studied incivility and reports findings that supports civility wins over incivility in every scenario including witness or bystander scenarios.  Leaders that choose civility are considered 2x more likely to be viewed by others as leaders.  Further research supports that incivility is toxic, destroys productivity, confidence, and negatively impacts the company bottom line.  

While we all have our imperfections, this a great reminder that those who feel respected are more focused, more engaged, and overall perform better.  Creating a civil environment starts with our conversations and how we discuss our team members, our engagement in meetings, and the pleasantries exchanged in the office all leave lasting impressions and eventually impacting the company bottom line.  If incivility remains unaddressed, the culture of the company degrades and overall success impaired.  However, small acts of kindness and lifting one another up are small initiatives that will create momentum for personal and professional success improving companies bottom line. 

Now imagine if we took this mindset beyond our corporate organizations!

I have often found there are two groups who can impact organizational change, but for opposite reason: the 'Why' and the 'Why Not' people.

The Why people: ¬†
 ¬†¬†Resistors who do not like change or do not think that THIS change is a good one.   These folks start off close minded with a mantra of ‚Äòif it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it‚Äô.

The Why Not people: ¬†
¬†¬†¬†Support change enthusiastically, often just for the sake of change.  They throw in ideas like ‚Äòuse AI‚Äô, ‚ÄòLets Automate‚Äô and 'six sigma lean!' without thinking through what it really means, the actual ROI and the execution plan.  They know change is good and want it to be exciting big breakout ideas all the time.  

Both groups can hurt change efforts.¬†Which do you think are more difficult to handle or have the most impact on the effectiveness of transformation?

As both an AI and Audiovisual enthusiast it's easy to understand why I'm so in awe of this new development from OpenAI. The thing that I find most interesting is the concept of ""patches"".

Sora uses ""patches"" instead of ""text tokens"" and this is fascinating. ""Patches"" refer to segments of visual data (such as parts of an image or frames from a video) that the model uses to understand and generate new content. 

Then by analyzing these patches, the model learns to simulate the physical world with high fidelity, enabling scalable learning across various video durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios.

This breakthrough suggests scaling video models could lead to advanced simulators of real and digital worlds. I really can't wait to try it.

üëâ First up, they've made it super user-friendly. Remember how we switched between modes like Code Interpreter, Data Analysis, Web Browsing, and DALL-E for images? Not anymore! Now, GPT smartly figures out what you need based on your prompt and even switches gears mid-conversation if needed. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for chats!

ü§Ø Second and this is the real mind-blower ‚Äì we can now create our own GPTs! Imagine designing a chatbot or a knowledge base tailored exactly to your needs. And you get to decide who uses it: just you, a select few, or the whole world. The possibilities here are endless!

üîç There's still a lot more to explore with this update. For starters, I've created two custom GPTs: one's a wizard at whipping up social media content and images: https://lnkd.in/erGidwBs, and the other's my personal assistant for grocery lists and meal prep https://lnkd.in/eWyFhriG. Talk about a major timesaver! Feel free to use them; they're open to everyone.

Stay tuned as I dive deeper into these features. I can't wait to see how they'll change the way we work and play. OpenAI, you've outdone yourselves!

Acabo de ver un post de una encuesta sobre pol√≠ticas para el uso de inteligencia artificial en empresas, las respuestas eran del estilo:
1. No necesitamos una pol√≠tica 
2. Trabajando en ello, etc. 

Y en los comentarios un mont√≥n de CEOs diciendo que no permit√≠an el uso de inteligencias artificiales en sus empresas. 

No soy una experta en esto - y adem√°s en este momento, desconf√≠o de cualquiera que se denomine as√≠ - pero mi intuici√≥n me dice que descontar completamente el uso de AI es la f√≥rmula perfecta para perder, perder frente a competidores, perder a talento capaz, perder eficiencia.

No tengo claro a√∫n c√≥mo debe manejarse, quiz√°s la creaci√≥n de pol√≠ticas es un buen primer paso. Pero creo que la inteligencia artificial lleg√≥ para quedarse y que taparnos los ojos y enfurru√±arnos en una esquina no es la soluci√≥n.

I just saw a post about a survey on policies for the use of artificial intelligence in companies, with responses like:
1. We don't need a policy
2. Working on it, etc. 

And in the comments, a lot of CEOs were saying that they don't allow the use of artificial intelligence in their companies.

I'm not an expert on this - and right now, I'm skeptical of anyone who calls themselves that - but my intuition tells me that completely discounting the use of AI is the perfect formula for losing - losing against competitors, losing capable talent, losing efficiency.

I'm not yet clear on how it should be managed, maybe the creation of policies is a good first step. But I do believe that artificial intelligence is here to stay and that turning a blind eye and sulking in a corner is not going to do businesses any good.

Please send a message to your lawmakers in Tallahassee urging them to vote NO on HB 837 and SB 236. We have found a way to mail a message and post a Tweet linked to your representatives very easily.

Here are the simple instructions on how you can do this via text:
(Your information will not be shared except for this communication)


Text the word RESIST to 50409.
You will first be given options of which representative you wish to contact. Text back ‚ÄúState.‚Äù
You will then be asked your first and last name so a letter can be created on your behalf. Enter First and last name. 
You will then be asked for your address so your state representatives can be determined.  Enter your address.
You will then be asked if you want to contact your Governor, Legislature, or Both. You will answer Both.
You will then be asked to text the message you want sent on your behalf. I suggest at a minimum that your message says: ‚ÄúVote NO on HB 837 and SB 236. These bills will strip the legal rights of Floridians‚Äù. 
 
You can paste in the following, or your own version of it‚Ä¶..

 
Vote NO on HB 837 and SB 236. These Bills will strip the legal rights of Floridians allowing Big Insurance to further disadvantage vulnerable injured and uninsured citizens.  Their passage will force uninsured patients to seek care in Emergency Rooms and cause a healthcare crisis for all Florida Healthcare consumers at a time when the State‚Äôs population is growing at unprecedented rates.  

HB 837 proposes unreasonable compensation for anesthesia and outpatient surgical centers that will require these providers to work at a loss.  Communities throughout the State already have shortages of  specialty physicians and the unintended consequence of passing this Bill will no doubt further the shortage of anesthesia services and shift of elective surgical work from the economic and efficient outpatient venue to hospital facilities.  This will overburden already over-taxed hospitals making care less available to the community and shift uninsured care to facilities that utilize public funds to subsidize trauma service, anesthesia and physician call coverage for injury related specialties including neurosurgery, orthopedics, trauma, vascular surgery and neurology. 

HB 837 does not discuss how projected cost savings will benefit Floridians.  There is no mention of premium reductions for all insured Florida drivers.  It appears we will all suffer the consequence of  these proposed changes that will only benefit already profitable auto insurers.  Physicians will depart the State and remaining resources will be unnecessarily challenged to serve accident victims.

Vote NO on HB 837 and SB 236.",4,0,0,4,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frankjbrady_attention-florida-urgent-read-please-activity-7040746390729195520-xSke

One thing not mentioned in¬†Ralph Sutton‚Äôs piece is the need for finance experts. When you‚Äôre looking at investing thousands or millions of dollars into a case, it‚Äôs vital you have a team who knows how to weigh the variable risks associated with such an investment.

As a team with more than 80 years of experience in finance, being able to weigh investment risk is one of our greatest strengths. I would argue the need for firms to hire savvy financial experts is going to grow exponentially in the coming years.¬†

Matt Thorley,matt-thorley,competitor,7006134128320364544,2022-12-07 05:55:43.869,"I am not a big fan of social media.  This is my first post ever on LinkedIn and my first post on any site in a very long time.  However I want to post here for two reasons.  First, I am hoping that sharing my thoughts will be healing and relatable.  Second, I need to find a new job.  

I was laid off from Filevine.  Saying it still feels surreal.  I had gotten to the point where I thought I would be at Filevine forever.  I was planning to ride that rocket ship for as long as I could hold on.  It wasn't always that way though.  7 years ago, my wife and I had just come home from teaching English in Taiwan and I was looking for a job to tide us over while we decided if and where we would go to grad school.  Based on a referral from a cousin, I landed an ""interview"" with Kyler M. where he forbade me from dressing up.  I could have never predicted what would come from that stroll around the parking lot. 

So while I am feeling sad, confused and betrayed that I am no longer working at Filevine, I am immensely grateful for the time that I had there.  I am grateful for all the amazing people that I worked with and the friends that I made.  I am grateful to have gained so much experience in so many different positions and have found a career that I love.  I am grateful to have been able to be part of a scrappy basement startup that transformed into a well tuned rocket.  I am devastated that I am no longer on that rocket but confident that it is still headed for amazing places.  

Most of all I am grateful for the confidence that my time at FV instilled in me.  Being part of that growing startup was not easy and I am proud of what I was able to accomplish there.  It may be 7 years later, but I think I am finally ready to figure out what comes next.  

So let all your friends know that there is a Product Owner/Manager on the market looking for a fresh new adventure.

I saw an item on your website last week priced at $1499.  I went to purchase it this week, and it's now priced at $2200 (and preported to be on sale)????  So, I chatted with customer service online and sent them the time-stamped photo of the item I'd taken last week showing the $1499 price.  They said there was nothing they could do and I'd have to pay $700 more for the same item because I waited a week.  I then called customer service and spoke with several people.  After waiting a half hour to speak with a manager, Maria Smith got on the line, and she did nothing but repeat the same diatribe.  I then asked to speak with HER supervisor and she said her leader doesn't take incoming calls.  I asked to leave a message, was not allowed to do so, and was also not given name or contact information to reach out via email.  Basically, they all shared that the ""higher ups in their organization had mandated that price adjustments for any reason were not allowed"".

This is a huge transition for many of us‚Äîwhether we're just leaving the military, spouses who have worked and lived within the military lifestyle, or veterans (like me) who have done something else entirely for over a decade and are trying something completely new! This program is giving us a chance at success. 

Thanks Iris Collis and Stephanie Murphy for answering all of our questions along the way! You have both been supportive and super helpful!! 

Thanks to the companies that host HOH Fellows! You recognize our worth and understand that not all of our strengths lie in a one to two page resume.

Noah Cutler,ncutler,competitor,6976179787715207168,2022-09-15 14:07:52.544,"Hello Friends! 

I have some exciting news to share! Those who know me, know that I have been working with the ARA Global Group for almost a year. They have a passion for driving growth and creating a better world for our children to live in. This global mission with a sustainable vision requires bold action. That is why our team has been quietly working to assemble one of the best circular economy leadership teams in the industry!

ARA has been matching used supply with used demand for 9 years. We will continue to be great at

mobility but we also have the capability to expand into other categories. There are more similarities than difference in the circular economy strategy that can grow beyond mobility and computing. 

Being able to reliably assess both cosmetic and functional condition then matching that supply to the demands of the next customer sounds very easy to do, but it takes an intentional strategy.

We are thrilled to announce that effective September 15th, ARA will operate under a new brand identity, RecirQ! Our mission is to promote reusing an item over recycling whenever possible. 

This sustainable approach is not only great for our environment, but
its also smart business. The circle in the Q is symbolic of a product making its way from your possession into the hands of the next customer. We help businesses like yours build a strategy around the next customer, Customer 2!

In addition to our new corporate identity, we have dramatically increased our capacity to deliver on our sustainability promise.

We are pleased to announce!

‚Ä¢Rich Bulger will have the pleasure of serving this team as the CEO. Rich has decades of experience in sustainability and reverse logistics. His background setting up Verizon‚Äôs trade in program and tenure leading Cisco‚Äôs global reverse logistics team make him a perfect person to lead this team.

‚Ä¢Mark Brausa will serve as our company's COO. Mark has over 20 years of industry experience and specializes in repair and refurbishment. He served as the President of Valuetech spent the last 3 years as the Vice President of Reverse Logistics and Repair at Ingram Micro. 

I will continue to lead as our CFO. We have a lot of work to do and we will continue to find new ways to innovate in this space while maintaining viciously consistent accounting practices.

‚Ä¢ Melanie Carter is joining RecirQ as our new CMO. Melanie is a marketing whiz who brings valuable agency experience to our team. 

‚Ä¢We are moving to a new 20K square foot facility right outside of Miami, in Hialeah Florida, at the end of September. 

‚Ä¢Effective today, we are launching our online bidding portal called ‚ÄúRecirQ Marketplace.‚Äù Our customers will now be able to log in to view our inventory and make purchasing decision 24/7!

‚Ä¢RecirQ has joined the Reverse Logistics Association as a Silver Member

Megan McGee,megan-trent-mcgee,competitor,6958819703527989249,2022-07-29 16:25:05.939,"When I was going for my PhD I had the WORST case of imposter syndrome. I was SURE people would find out that I wasn't smart enough to be there. After all, you have to be super smart to get your PhD, right?

For years I fought with that. I remember carpooling with a friend of mine and admitting that I was sure my profs were going to realize I was an idiot any day now. She said she felt the same way. We began talking about all of the things we didn't understand in our classes.

It was then that I realized that most of us feel this way and it's a hindrance to my learning. So, I began admitting, in my PhD classes, that I didn't understand. I remember one class, specifically, where the professor asked what the argument of the book was and I said, ""If it wasn't written on the back of the book, I would have had no idea."" And that was the truth. I had read it; it was a mess. The other students agreed with me. 

That was the beginning of my growth mindset, I think. Now, I have that PhD, but man, I know that I don't know a lot. But, I also know that I'm capable of learning. I love learning. I'll go out of my way to figure things out. 

It even happens with professors. I was in a seminar about hy-flex learning and we were about to be split into zoom groups and given a task. Everyone was silent for a while after the instructors explained the task, but I was clueless as to what we were supposed to do. I unmuted myself, and said, I have no idea what we're supposed to be doing. I don't understand the task at all; can you try explaining it differently? Then they asked if others needed clarification, and EVERYONE else nodded. Like, come on, people, just admit it. But, when you think everyone else understands, it's hard to be the single person admitting you don't.

Don't let imposter syndrome hold you back. If you have it, you're not alone. But allowing yourself the vulnerability of admitting not knowing something leads to knowing it.

Reports are tough for me‚ÄîI breezed through the Dashboard components, though. It's weird how we can have difficulty with some things and do really well with others. I can understand reports theoretically, but getting all of the report components to pass the steps wasn't easy! 

Some things for me to remember as I look toward my next one:

1. DON'T make things harder than they already are. (I don't know why I look at something and think, it CAN'T just be that, right?)
2. Name reports and DB (anything, really) first‚Äîthat way I'm not editing and adding underscores to 'unique' names later.
3. When I get formula validation errors for parentheses and I've counted my parentheses a billion times, it's not my parentheses‚Äîit's probably my commas. 
4. Chrome is awesome, but sometimes, it can be pretty fickle. If things aren't acting right, try a different browser. 
5. It's ok to stop when you're frustrated and pick it up again the next day (this one took me 3). 

To those who are good at reports‚ÄîI look at you in awe!! 

And with that one I finished my Admin Super Set. I think my next one will be Process Automation. :)

Having never been through a merger, let alone one that took shape in a matter of weeks and not months, I was unprepared on what to expect or prepare my team for once we made the announcement to them on January 2nd.  Often change is thought of negatively, but so many of our recent changes have brought us excitement and celebratory achievements.  These are just a few of the many exciting changes that have transpired for Injury Finance and OMNI Healthcare.  Together we continue to build upon our incredible team focused on providing outstanding service.  I cannot be more proud, or excited for these changes and the many more ahead of us!  Cheers!

Why is it important to know your blind spots? Because it is a necessary part of your personal growth. Blind spots are things that you are unaware of. Identifying our blind spots and understanding them heighten our self-awareness.

When we develop a greater self-awareness, we become more aligned with our higher selves, which means a greater self-mastery. Getting a personal coach is an excellent way to uncover your own blind spots so that you can improve.

Blind spots aren‚Äôt necessarily negative traits or weaknesses, though they usually are. When you are oblivious to something, there is a high likelihood that (1) you have never worked on it before, which leaves an opportunity for improvement, and (2) it serves as an invisible boundary that limits what you can do. For example, if you are not aware that you have poor time management skills, you will always operate within the confines of poor planning and prioritization, without knowing that it‚Äôs due to your lack of this skill. Or if you are not aware that you have poor communication skills, you may often feel frustrated when communicating with others, without realizing that it‚Äôs due to this focus area.

When you uncover your blind spots and actively work on them, you become more conscious of your strengths and opportunity areas, and the boundaries that you are operating within. If you don‚Äôt uncover these blind spots, you will never be able to work on them, simply because you aren‚Äôt aware of their existence.

As someone who is passionate about growth, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for situations when I feel resistance or when my consciousness is lowered, as it indicates a blind spot. On my blog, I open myself to feedback that I receive from readers, whether positive or negative. During my 1-1 coaching, I would encourage my clients to provide feedback to help improve the coaching sessions.

Over the years, I‚Äôve uncovered many blind spots and worked on them. In the past, my perfectionism often resulted in ineffective work patterns, which hindered me from achieving greater results. These blocked me from being the person I wanted to be. It was through conscious work on these blind spots that I‚Äôve seen shifts and improved as a person.

Just like growth is a lifelong journey, the process of uncovering blind spots never ends. With every blind spot that we identify and tackle, there is always a next blind spot to uncover. Due to the vastness of our mind and the infinite nature of growth, it is impossible to identify every single blind spot within us, right now. What‚Äôs more important is to work on improving every second, every moment, as we move forward in our life‚Äôs journey.",5,0,0,5,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_im-seeing-blind-spots-why-is-it-important-activity-6918943869376032768-T4hj

While we can‚Äôt change the past, we can change the present, and by doing so, change the past. Our pasts are not cast in stone but instead are fluid, always being recast through the lens of the present. You know this is true if you‚Äôve ever been through a serious break-up. Suddenly you find yourself looking back at the relationship with new eyes. You mentally rearrange memories, discover new ones. You are automatically creating a new narrative that matches your current state of affairs.

But what we do automatically we can do deliberately. By consciously changing what we do in the present we create a new lens through which to view our past. And more importantly, by acting differently in the present, we break the past-affirming cycle, rewrite the seemingly inevitable storyline created through our actions that literally rewire our brains, and, in turn, change our view of our world and ourselves.

Often, we remain sensitive to our wounds in part because we lack closure of past events. Getting closure is taking active steps to emotionally begin to put events to rest, and can be as simple as saying what we couldn‚Äôt say back then. By being proactive you are taking active steps to change the narrative. Your action itself recasts your role in your story: you are no longer a passive victim.

Finally, the rewounding and the triggering of the past are being driven by the coping style, likely unconscious, you developed way back when and born out of the few options you had at that time. But while it worked then, it doesn‚Äôt serve you now in the adult world. Instead of helping, it now only keeps alive those child feelings, that child view of the world.

The way to upgrade your coping style is through conscious adult action. What you are essentially doing by deliberately changing your reactions is doing now what you were unable to do as child. You are being assertive, approaching problems from the position of an empowered adult rather than that of a frightened child. These assertive actions with practice help you recast your view of yourself as vulnerable and, in turn, make you less susceptible to triggering of your wounds.

You come to learn that the world, after all, isn‚Äôt quite as unsafe as you thought; you don‚Äôt have to stay on edge worrying about disasters, but instead can take decisive action. And as you do this, old wounds, and the past they are connected to, will no longer hold you back.",0,0,0,0,0,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_a-new-lens-while-we-cant-change-the-past-activity-6913465409153183744-C-hR

I would guess everyone has had to deal with haters at one point or another in their life, whether it‚Äôs a school bully growing up, or a mean-spirited adult. When someone is a hater they do everything in their power to make others feel small and to tear other people down. They often come off as incredibly confident and pleased with themselves, but the reality is that they are neither of those things.  Haters are insecure and unhappy with themselves, and they manifest it by spreading hate‚Ä¶after all, misery loves company‚Ä¶ 

I wish every child out there could have a copy of the quote below so they could understand that haters don‚Äôt actually hate the person they hate on at all. They hate themselves because they wish they could be everything that you are! 

If anyone reading this is thinking to themselves ‚Äúthe girl hating on me is so pretty‚Äù or ‚Äúthe guy bullying me is so athletic‚Äù or ‚Äúthe coworker hating on me is so smart‚Äù so you are wondering how they could possibly be insecure or want to be you when are so great themselves?   Guess what, they are absolutely insecure because haters haven‚Äôt yet learned to value themselves ‚Äì if they did value themselves then they wouldn‚Äôt be picking on you!

Happy and secure people don‚Äôt tear other people down. In fact, happy and secure people build other people up and that is why they continue to be so happy ‚Äì they are comfortable in their own skin and happy with themselves so they don‚Äôt sit and compare themselves to others because they recognize that we are all amazing in our own way, which allows them to be happy for others rather than envying them. 

So the next time you are dealing with a hater, try giving them a genuine compliment. Honestly find something you admire about that person and find way to tell them. It may feel awkward and uncomfortable at first, but that‚Äôs okay. No matter how awkward it feels to do you will walk away from it feeling better about yourself, whether they respond favorably or not. You know why? Because you giving them a sincere compliment shows that you are a secure and happy person yourself! 

So smile and feel good and if they hate on you tomorrow do it again‚Ä¶the more you do it the happier you will be, and maybe one day they will actually take the compliment to heart and start to see that they do have value.",4,0,1,5,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_haters-gonna-hate-i-would-guess-everyone-activity-6906569294046732288-T-iE

Our society places value on staying in control and creating a life that is always organized, structured, and planned. It‚Äôs a practice that can leave you stressed and depressed. Learn how meditation, love, and awareness can help set you free.

However, no matter how it looks from the outside, no one is ever truly in control.

Your fear and control-seeking arise from concern about the unknown. Engage the world more so that you are more comfortable.

The ability to convey support for a partner, relative, or friend is crucial to establishing positive relationships. Empathy enables us to establish rapport with another person, make them feel that they are being heard, and, through words and body language, mimic their emotions. The ability to assume the cognitive state of another person and see a problem through their eyes, can further cement a connection.

In healthy relationships, people expect their partners to empathize with them when they face hardship or personal struggles, but the ability to empathize with a partner in good times may be just as important. In one study, displaying empathy for a partner‚Äôs positive emotions was five times more beneficial for relationships than only empathizing with his or her negative emotions.

People high in narcissism, or who have narcissistic personality disorder, can exhibit empathy and even compassion. However, that ability only goes so far, as ultimately their own needs come first. Mental health professionals believe narcissists can build empathy by developing greater self-compassion, which can increase their own feelings of security and self-worth and enable them to open up to hearing others.",4,0,0,4,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_i-know-you-the-ability-to-convey-support-activity-6898822615776276481-yUDg

Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

Reputation that is gained without character is hypocrisy. Reputation that grows out of good character is simply giving honor to whom honor is due.

Character is within your power. Reputation is something over which you have little control.

Character cannot be taken away from you by anyone. Reputation can be stolen from you by liars.

Striving for character is strength. Aiming solely at reputation is weakness. Character endures difficulty.

The person of character is often out in front, regardless of who is following. The reputation seeker cannot lead the way because he cannot move in any direction until he is assured that the army is already headed that way.",6,0,0,6,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_character-over-reputation-be-more-concerned-activity-6896256114577788928-3LLX

Gut instinct, or intuition, is your immediate understanding of something; there‚Äôs no need to think it over or get another opinion‚Äîyou just know. Your intuition arises as a feeling within your body that only you experience. Because the feeling is so personal, no one else can weigh in to tell you if you‚Äôre in touch with your gut instinct or not. You alone have to make the call. Because of this, trusting your intuition is the ultimate act of trusting yourself.

Listening to your intuition helps you avoid unhealthy relationships and situations. Throughout your life, many people will have ideas about what‚Äôs best for you, some held with good intentions and some coming from a place of deceitful, harmful, selfish intent. It‚Äôs sometimes hard to tell which category someone falls into, but if you put aside all of those external opinions and instead listen to the advice of your own intuition, it will guide you to what is truly best for you.

The feeling of intuition is like an ocean current navigating you toward a purposeful life. Once you discover it, you still need to jump in a boat and set sail in order to derive its full value. After you answer the question ‚ÄúWhat do I need right now?‚Äù, do something to give yourself what you need. It might be the tiniest step, but size doesn‚Äôt matter here. Small steps can actually be beneficial at first to gradually build trust with your intuitive self whom you may be meeting for the first time or becoming reacquainted with after an unhealthy relationship separated you. What‚Äôs important is that you are following your intuition.

Remember that trusting your intuition is a journey which will lead you back as circumstances change and life continues to move onwards. Consider your intuition as a muscle to strengthen. With purposeful practice and frequent use, it will become more powerful and better serve its purpose‚Äîguiding you home to yourself.",4,0,0,4,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_just-trust-your-gut-gut-instinct-or-intuition-activity-6893827987083784192-_Ouo

When we‚Äôve experienced safety, security and love, we know that we‚Äôre worthy of it. And we also know what to look out for. We naturally gravitate towards people who offer it. And we quickly change course when we come across those who don‚Äôt.

But if these basic needs were not fulfilled in our early life, this inner knowing might not come so naturally. We may have a sense that something‚Äôs missing ‚Äì and feel frustrated and hurt ‚Äì but we probably won‚Äôt know what to do about it. We might even struggle to put our finger on what the issue is.

The problem with this is that it leaves us passive. We allow life ‚Äì and people ‚Äì to lead us in all kinds of directions, whether they suit us or not. When we don‚Äôt know what we need, how can we expect others to know?

So our relationship with ourselves comes first and foremost. As soon as we‚Äôve identified our needs, we empower ourselves with the ability to ask for them to be met. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean that they will be. But hopefully it means that we will get most of what we need.

If you‚Äôve spent a lifetime sacrificing your own needs for the needs of others, you might feel guilty as you start expressing your needs ‚Äì but it‚Äôs important to work this through. Just acknowledge the feeling, and gently let it go.

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships. It is a covert type of emotional abuse where the abuser misleads the target, creating a false narrative and making them question their judgments and reality. Ultimately, the victim of gaslighting starts to feel unsure about their perceptions of the world and even wonder if they are losing their sanity.

This behavior primarily occurs in romantic relationships, but it's not uncommon for it to occur in controlling friendships or among family members as well. People who gaslight others may have mental health disorders, such as narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD). They use this type of emotional abuse to exert power in order to manipulate friends, family members, or even co-workers.

Gaslighting is a technique that undermines a person's perception of reality. When someone is gaslighting you, you may second-guess yourself, your memories, recent events, and your perceptions. After communicating with the person gaslighting you, you may be left feeling dazed and wondering if there is something wrong with you. You may be encouraged to think you are actually to blame for something or that ‚Äúyou're just being too sensitive‚Äù.

This practice can confuse you and cause you to question your judgment, memory, self-worth, and overall mental health. Being constantly subjected to can cause anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns including addiction and thoughts of suicide. For this reason, it's important to recognize when you're experiencing gaslighting.

Remember that you are not to blame for what you are experiencing. The person gaslighting you is making a choice to behave this way. They are responsible for their actions. Nothing you did caused them to make this choice, and you won't be able to change what they're doing.

But, with effective mental health counseling and coaching, you can learn how to make healthy choices and set boundaries with the person who engages in gaslighting. Ultimately, you may reach a place where you feel ready to move on from the relationship.",13,2,0,15,15.38,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_got-a-match-gaslighting-is-a-form-of-manipulation-activity-6885631882042609665-YHAe

People-pleasing is a losing battle. When you focus on self-love and self-compassion rather than trying to get others to love you, you build your self-esteem and break codependent patterns so you can form healthier, happier relationships with yourself and others.

For various reasons, many of us find it easier to love others than to love ourselves. Sometimes we‚Äôre truly awful to ourselves. We subject ourselves to a harsh inner critic, unhealthy relationships, toxic substances, and many other forms of self-harm. But regardless of the reasons for your lack of self-love, it‚Äôs time to start caring for yourself and treating yourself with the same love that you give to others.

Loving yourself isn‚Äôt selfish. Not only does it improve your relationship with yourself, but it shows others how to love you. You are the one person that you‚Äôll always be with. So, it‚Äôs important that you enjoy your own company, can trust yourself, and recognize your good qualities.

We try to improve everything external to ourselves, and this can never be done. We try to change our environment, meet certain people, do certain things, and we think this will make us happy. But it only lasts for a short time, doesn't it? And you're right back to what you were before.

This world can never make you happy, it's impossible. It may appear to make you happy for a while because you're gaining something that you want. But it will only last a short time.

True happiness comes from nothing.

When your happiness arises from nothingness, then you're truly happy, because nothing made you happy and nothing can take it away. If something makes you happy, and then something takes it away, you will be miserable. 

But if you learn to achieve happiness from nothing, this is everlasting. It will never leave you, because there is nothing to change.

In past blogs, I‚Äôve touched on the topic of forgiveness. Recently, clients have requested an additional post for further consideration-benefit. So here we go!

When someone wrongs you somehow, you might feel certain you‚Äôll never be able to get over it. Even after your immediate anger passes, you might continue to dwell on the betrayal instead of letting it fade into memory. It‚Äôs pretty common to feel this way. But not being able to forgive can harm you most.

Forgiveness might seem challenging, in part because it‚Äôs often misunderstood. You might believe forgiving someone means forgetting what happened, implying the pain they caused was no big deal.

In reality, forgiveness simply means choosing to let go of your anger, hurt, and desire for vengeance. You might accept that what happened is now in the past, recognize that people make mistakes, and begin cultivating compassion instead.

Many people view forgiveness as something that helps the person being forgiven. It certainly can make them feel better, but forgiveness benefits YOU, most of all.

Holding onto resentment can create bitterness and keep you from finding peace. When you can‚Äôt forgive, your emotional wounds can‚Äôt close and heal. Forgiveness enables you to begin moving away from anger and resentment before they seep into all areas of your life. Harboring anger toward someone who hurt you doesn‚Äôt just affect your relationship with that person. Grudges and angry feelings can overflow into other relationships.

By practicing forgiveness, you may be doing your health a favor. Forgiveness helps reduce stress, which can lead to positive health outcomes, including lower blood pressure, reduced anxiety, better sleep, and improved self-esteem. It can also lead to more fulfilling relationships ‚Äî including the one you have with yourself. 

People often struggle with forgiveness when they blame themselves, at least in some small way, for what happened. Self-compassion and self-forgiveness are important tools to have before trying to forgive someone else. It‚Äôs important to consider whether self-blame may be getting in the way of your ability to forgive. Remember, someone else‚Äôs decision to hurt you is NEVER your fault.

If you have trouble forgiving yourself, particularly for circumstances where you did nothing wrong, discussing with a mental health counselor, coach or therapist may help.",5,1,0,6,20.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_forgiveness-helps-you-heal-in-past-blogs-activity-6870864579509964800-FY78

A codependent relationship is when one partner needs the other partner, who in turn, needs to be needed. This circular relationship is the basis of what experts refer to when they describe the ‚Äúcycle‚Äù of codependency.

The codependent‚Äôs self-esteem and self-worth will come only from sacrificing themselves for their partner, who is only too glad to receive their sacrifices.

One or both parties can be codependent. A codependent person will neglect other important areas of their life to please their partner. Their extreme dedication to this one person may cause damage to other relationships, their career, and their everyday responsibilities.

The enabler‚Äôs role is also dysfunctional. A person who relies upon a codependent does not learn how to have an equal, two-sided relationship and often comes to rely upon another person‚Äôs sacrifices and neediness. The codependent person will feel extreme conflict about separating themselves from the enabler because their own identity is centered upon sacrificing themselves for the other person.

Growing up, they may have been taught that their own needs were less important than their parents‚Äô needs, or not important at all. In these types of families, the child may be taught to focus on their parents and to never think of themselves. Needy parents may teach their children that children are selfish or greedy if they want anything for themselves. As a result, the child learns to ignore their own needs and thinks only of what they can do for others at all times.

Both parties in a codependent relationship must learn to acknowledge specific patterns of behavior, such as ‚Äúneeding to be needed‚Äù and expecting the other person to center their life around them.

These steps are not easy to do but are well worth the effort to help both parties discover how to be in a balanced, two-sided relationship.",6,0,0,6,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_needing-to-be-needed-a-codependent-relationship-activity-6868894556897775616-9xhG

Every relationship has a cycle. In the beginning; you fall in love with your partner. You anticipate their calls, want their touch, and like their idiosyncrasies. Falling in love wasn't hard. In fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You didn't have to DO anything. That's why it's called ""falling"" in love. People in love sometimes say, ""I was swept off my feet.‚Äù Picture the expression. It implies that you were just standing there; doing nothing, and then something happened TO YOU.

But after a few months or years of being together, the euphoria of love fades. It's a natural cycle of every relationship. Slowly but surely, phone calls become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome (when it happens), and your partner‚Äôs idiosyncrasies, instead of being cute, drive you nuts. The symptoms of this stage vary with every relationship; you will notice a dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and a much duller or even angry subsequent stage. At this point, you and/or your partner might start asking, ""Am I with the right person?"" And as you reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had, you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when relationships breakdown.

The key to succeeding in a relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the person you found. People blame their partners for their unhappiness and look outside for fulfillment. Infidelity is the most common. But sometimes people turn to work, a hobby, friendship, excessive TV, or abusive substances. But the answer to this dilemma does not lie outside your relationship. It lies within it.

SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. You have to work on it day in and day out. It takes time, effort, and energy. And most importantly, it demands wisdom. You have to know what to do to make it work. Just as there are physical laws of the universe (such as gravity), there are also universal laws for relationships. If you know how to apply these laws, the results are predictable.

Remember that love is a ""decision‚Äù and not just a feeling.",7,1,0,8,14.29,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_are-you-with-the-right-partner-every-relationship-activity-6863149834271039488-V_p1

Holding on to pain doesn‚Äôt fix anything. Replaying the past over and over again doesn‚Äôt change it, and wishing things were different doesn‚Äôt make it so. In some cases, especially when it comes to the past, all we can do is accept whatever it is we are holding on to and then let it go. That‚Äôs how everything changes. We have to let go of what is hurting us, even if it feels almost impossible. Deciding to hold on to the past will hold us back from creating a strong sense of self ‚Äî a self that isn‚Äôt defined by our past, but rather by who we want to be. 

Oddly enough, painful feelings can be comfortable, especially if they‚Äôre all we know. Some people have trouble letting go of their pain or other unpleasant emotions about their past because they think those feelings are part of their identity. In some ways, they may not know who they are without their pain. This makes it impossible for them to let go.

We must accept the person we are in this moment and the way other people are, too. As time goes on, we continue to learn that things don‚Äôt always go as planned ‚Äî actually, they pretty much never do. And that‚Äôs okay: If you become aware of yourself and your part in your relationships, they will improve; however, you may also have to accept the facts about how certain people may choose to show up.

Feelings emanate from chemicals in our brain and are greatly influenced by our thoughts, biology and environment. Perhaps we‚Äôll never quite control our feelings, but we can learn to manage them. And one helpful way to do so is to express them.

Why is it so important to talk about one‚Äôs feelings? Is it a sign of weakness to do so? Not at all, according to mental health research. Letting feelings ‚Äúout‚Äù by talking about them with a trusted friend or mental health counselor strengthens us, both physically and emotionally. Holding our feelings in can cause anxiety, depression, headaches, high blood pressure and more. Learning  to identify and express our feelings can reduce or even eliminate such symptoms.

Before talking about your feelings, you must know what they are. Are you feeling sad or frustrated? Lonely or disappointed? If possible, spend some time alone thinking about your feelings, tuning in to your mind and body. Come up with specific words that describe exactly how you feel. Write them down if it helps.

When you talk about your feelings, it also might help to:

1) Describe the degree of your feelings. Are you furious or mildly irritated? Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù messages: ‚ÄúI feel _________ when __________.‚Äù
2) Take full responsibility for your feelings, rather than blame others. Even if their behavior bothers you, your feelings are uniquely yours to express and to manage.
3) Choose a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù audience, someone who is willing to listen and to do so without interrupting or judging you.
4) Talk to a counselor, coach or mental health professional if your feelings overwhelm you and disrupt your life.

As beneficial to you as it is to talk about your feelings, there are some cautions to consider:

1) Avoid using ‚Äúyou‚Äù messages either intentionally or disguised as ‚ÄúI‚Äù messages. ‚ÄúI feel ______ because you always _________.‚Äù
2) Talking ‚Äúat‚Äù or blaming the listener forcing an unwilling person to listen to you.
3) Re-hashing an upsetting event over and over by repeatedly talking about it. This might rekindle negative feelings that you had vented with the first telling, confusing the listener with your body language, such as smiling when you are angry.
4) Talking only about negative feelings, expecting others to feel the same way you do by demanding that others share their feelings with you.

The purpose of talking about a feeling is to ‚Äúlet it out‚Äù in a positive way so that it cannot continue to bother you.

We all make decisions throughout our lives, and sometimes decisions are made for us. During those times the choice we have is how we will respond, which is a powerful type of decision making, in and of itself. We can refuse to be defined by circumstances beyond our control. 

Knowing that we are always one decision away from totally changing our lives generates empowerment. That knowledge keeps us from blaming others regarding our journey and frees us from victim. If we want things to change, we are responsible for making decisions that bring about change, even if we can‚Äôt see exactly what the ultimate outcome will be. Trust is involved. If we make a decision and then take actions in alignment with that decision, we can trust that the Universe is moving to meet us, bringing the right opportunities and people into our lives, at the right time.

These milestones are very encouraging as I see how my life has shifted, in positive and remarkable ways, from decisions that were made, one at a time. I can see the progression, the changes that have occurred, from decision to decision. Such a journey allows me to remain open to all that is unfolding now, moment by moment. 

What decision are you ready to make that will totally change your life? Is it around your health? A relationship? Your career? Your destiny? Change begins with a decision, your decision, something you choose apart from the expectations of others. Paulo Coelho says that a mistake repeated more than once is a decision as well. Are there decisions you are unwittingly making, that are defining your life?

Honesty is not just about telling the truth. It‚Äôs about being real with yourself and others about who you are, what you want and what you need to live your most authentic life. Honesty promotes openness, empowers us and enables us to develop consistency in how we present the facts. It sharpens our perception and allows us to observe everything around us with clarity. As an executive coach, I work with leaders looking to focus on honesty with themselves first, before even considering how to deal effectively with others.

The opposite of honesty is deception or lying. Lying is equally harmful whether you are deceiving others or yourself. When you lie, you delude yourself into believing what you‚Äôre saying. You confuse yourself, confuse others, lose credibility and put yourself at risk. The worst type of lying we practice, in order to deceive, is when we lie to ourselves. We start blurring our concept of morality, right and wrong, as well as our own dreams and desires.

When I look back, every time I lied I was trying to excuse or misrepresent my own shortcomings or to compensate for something. I was trying to pursue a selfish desire that would only, at best, produce a temporary reward. Other times, I was convincing myself that I wasn‚Äôt good enough or unable to do something my heart was really set on. It set me back by delaying the pursuit of my dreams. It took away my ability to take chances that my heart was willing to take, but my mind was blocking.

Honesty cuts through distraction, frustration and indecision. Honesty gets you where you want to go faster because you LIVE how you really FEEL. You may not always know what you want in your future ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs one month, six months or two years from now ‚Äî but your intuition will give you a feel for what is in harmony with your heart.

Honest intentions in speech and action gain the attention and respect of others. These people become the ones that you not only want to influence but be influenced by. The company we keep and surround ourselves with help to define our outlook on life, as well as lift us to places we couldn‚Äôt have arrived at entirely by our own efforts.

These days, my success is not quantified in terms of dollars, sales or the number of social media followers. I value success in terms of character, self-awareness, emotional intelligence, how we treat ourselves, and how we use our talents to improve the lives of others.",5,0,0,5,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_honestly-honest-honesty-is-not-just-about-activity-6846249506854514688-V0LY

When we feel criticized or misunderstood, the urge to prove ourselves to others can show up at times. We all get caught up in a painful impulse of wanting to say things back at the person who criticizes us. We end up rehearsing an endless story about who is right or wrong and why.

From a psychological point of view, what does the need to prove ourselves reflect about ourselves? What is our intention when we try to prove ourselves? What are we trying to get out of the action?

The need to prove ourselves to others often stems from a moment of feeling vulnerable, unaccepted, undermined, or misunderstood. There is a deep sense of unworthiness behind it. The urge of wanting to prove ourselves tries to protect us from the most vulnerable feelings of unworthiness. When we rely on others for validating our self-worth, we can get easily hurt. We don‚Äôt need other people to validate if we are already feeling worthy and enough.

When we notice the impulsive urge to justify ourselves, there are two useful things we can do.

1) Notice a feeling and name it
2) Allow yourself to sit with a feeling and say to yourself ‚ÄúI am feeling xxx and that‚Äôs OK‚Äù

These two steps are simple and yet extremely powerful. We can investigate what lies behind the urge to justify ourselves, as this practice cultivates a deep sense of self-acceptance of whatever we experience without judgement. Self-acceptance is a foundation of self-confidence, since the more accepting we become of ourselves, the more we can trust our own experience and stand in our power.

In this process of developing self-awareness and self-acceptance, we will be able to break the chain of reactivity of negative emotions and choose a new or different way to respond to the situation. As long as we are OK in our hearts, others‚Äô opinions and behaviors won‚Äôt matter much to us. 

When we feel the urge to prove ourselves, we can communicate with ourselves first, rather than trying to communicate with the other person. Become intimate with our vulnerable parts which are hurting and afraid, and want to be nurtured. This is the act of compassion for ourselves.

It takes a conscious practice of cultivating our self-worth when we feel criticized or rejected. Let‚Äôs prove ourselves to ourselves, and not to others.",2,0,0,2,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_prove-it-when-we-feel-criticized-or-misunderstood-activity-6843507291338158080-DNph

- Iyanla Vanzant

When you've already spent a lot of time and energy on someone, it can feel like a waste to just let all of that hard work go. But sometimes the choice to walk away is less of a loss than the choice to stay and hope things will change.

When you're more invested in someone than they are in you, there's a good chance that you'll be doing a lot of the work. You can only plan dates and initiate conversations for so long before you start feeling unappreciated. It can feel a lot worse if you're in a situation where they're keeping their options open. So it‚Äôs important to always trust your gut.

If the person you're waiting for has baggage from a past relationship or issues from childhood, it's going to effect how they view relationships and commitment. You can't force someone to work through their issues if they don't want to. A person can‚Äôt be expected to wait for another person to grow emotionally and become more mature.

When they experience something lucky, group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. 

Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those lights up in the sky in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation is a fifty-fifty. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. 

But there's a whole lot of people in group number one. When they see those lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. 

See, what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, that sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky?

During a BRUTAL study at John Hopkins in the 1950s, Dr. Curt Richter placed rats in a pool of water to test how long they could tread water (https://lnkd.in/eN7_QYTu).

On average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes.

But right before they gave up due to exhaustion, the researchers would pluck them out, dry them off, let them rest for a few minutes - and put them back in for a second round.

In this second try - how long do you think they lasted? 

Remember - they had just swam until failure only a few short minutes ago..

How long do you think?

Another 15 minutes?

10 minutes?

5 minutes?

Nah!

60 hours!!!!

That's not an error. 

That's right! 60 hours of swimming.

The conclusion drawn was that since the rats BELIEVED that they would eventually be rescued, they could push their bodies way past what they previously thought impossible.

I will leave you with this thought:

If hope can cause exhausted rats to swim for that long, what could a belief in yourself and your abilities, do for you?

Remember what you‚Äôre capable of. 

Remember why you‚Äôre here.

Everyone in life fails at something. When we fail, it causes a tremendous amount of pain. And, our mind does whatever it can to help avoid the pain. It‚Äôs not easy when we fail, but the pain from failure can actually be our biggest blessing.

However, when we are surrounded by negativity, it can help to exponentially increase the pain of failure or even the potential pain for failure. Even if we didn‚Äôt fail at something, the fear of failing itself tends to hold us back. That fear is bred not only by the mind itself in its quest to avoid pain, but also by other external influencers such as friends, family and peers.

What we can realize during these moments is that our greatest failures are also our greatest blessings.

Experiencing deep emotional pain can make one fearful of their next relationship because we are afraid of going through the pain again. Afraid to love someone who may not love you in return. Afraid you may give so much of yourself that you will end up being used or taken advantage of. This is because emotional pain creates deep fractures and wounds that feel as if they will never heal, making new relationships difficult to sustain because of the fear of more potential pain.

Fearing pain means you are fearing living. As a child, if you feared getting a skinned knee, you would never play again. You don‚Äôt worry about the knee because it is more important to you to enjoy playing, exploring and having fun. Once you get that band-aid and a hug, you are off to exploration and discovery again. Sadly, as adults we forget that pain simply warns us that we hurt ourselves, and teaches us not to try the crazy stunt we did that caused us to fall and get the skinned knee. We forget that we simply address the wound and get back out there and play, so we decide we need to carry the pain around with us. Instead of playing and enjoying life, we are stuck suffering in the pain we never allowed to heal or took time to learn from.

Healing emotional wounds cannot be buried and left to fester. It will not just go away. It‚Äôs like having a deeply inflicted flesh wound that you do not attend to. It will not heal without your attention. You can‚Äôt amputate your heart. You have to heal it or drown in the infection of the pain you continue to carry, which will hinder you from ever having a truly loving relationship in the future.

Relationships break down for various reasons, but pointing blame to the other person for the breakdown will not resolve this pain. You may feel betrayed, used, misused, abused, crushed, overwhelmed, or abandoned from the pain that has been inflicted upon you by someone you love.

However, shutting down your emotional system to put your feelings on hold will not heal the pain you are suffering from. You must do the work to resolve the pain and move into your healing. Simply covering or burying the pain only patches you temporarily until you meet someone new and something happens that triggers the deeply rooted pain you never resolved before, which sadly, you will blame on the new relationship.
 
Stop and address the issues deep within. It‚Äôs not the relationships. Its the pain that has festered within that is sabotaging the love you desire to have manifest in your life.

A toxic relationship is a relationship that is unhealthy for the people involved. This relationship may have started off great, but somewhere along the line, things changed.

Healthy relationships might experience bumps along the way, but they're generally not severe and they don't happen all the time. In a toxic relationship, your partner might not acknowledge the part they are playing to make the relationship difficult.

Some of the main characteristics of toxic relationships are emotional abuse, physical abuse, lying and cheating, gas-lighting, and dislike or distrust. If you see these things in your relationship they should raise a red flag. Ask yourself, is this is the right person for you?

Need help because you are or think you might know someone who is in a toxic relationship?

It‚Äôs knowing what we feel and why, and being able and willing to share it with others, even when it‚Äôs painful to ourselves.

General integrity involves being honest with others. Emotional Integrity involves being honest with oneself: facing uncomfortable or painful truths inside ourselves so that they don‚Äôt harm the people we love. It‚Äôs more about our internal choices than our external ones. It‚Äôs the opposite of what we think of as denial.  It‚Äôs the opposite of avoidance.

It‚Äôs entirely possible to be a person of good integrity while also lacking Emotional Integrity. We have a natural tendency to avoid difficult things, such as painful feelings, conflict, problems, or our own weaknesses. It‚Äôs somewhat built into us to take the easier route. It‚Äôs not always clear to us that the easier route carries its own threat; a threat to our Emotional Integrity.

Below are five tips to achieve greater Emotional Integrity:

1. Remember that painful feelings are temporary. They go away much faster and cleaner when they are faced and dealt with. Avoiding the pain only gives it more power over you.

2. Know that when you are not honest with yourself, it may very possibly hurt the people around you. Taking the easier route always comes with a price.

3. Take seriously your duty to know yourself. People who love you rely upon this!

4. Be willing to say things that others might find painful. Speak your truth always with compassion and care.

5. Own your mistakes and weaknesses. We all have them. And it is far more honest to accept and face them than to ignore or hide them.",3,0,0,3,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_what-is-emotional-integrity-its-knowing-activity-6813332151119986688-HRL-

We've all experienced others who truly believe they are always right and will never apologize. What‚Äôs going on inside the other person‚Äôs head, frankly, is none of our business.

All we can do is focus on ourselves and our own emotional integrity. It's important to realize that we are the bigger person for being mindful and accepting situations as they are. We cannot change people; we can only change the way we think about others.

Sometimes, this means accepting an apology that we will never get. By telling ourselves that there's an apology, it can be easier to forgive and let go. Whether we believe it or not, the majority of people do feel sorry but are too prideful to admit it.

To move on from resentment, anxiety, tension, and hurt, we have to forgive the people that hurt us. One of the most difficult aspects of relationships is letting go of hurt feelings. However, we must take our own internal peace into account and put ourselves before anyone else. 

Forgiveness, really, is about having mastered self-control. If we are able to forgive someone without conditions, we are able to assert ourselves over our feelings.

The world is full of mirrors and reflections. We have mirror neurons in our brains that cause us to emulate the communication,‚ÄØbehavior, and energy we observe in others. Plus, those around us mirror us back. Knowing this, we have the choice of what we want to reflect to the world.

Beyond being mirrors of each other,‚ÄØour internal dialogues in our minds transmit a ripple effect through our mirroring behavior. Our thoughts, our inner critic, and our inner cheerleader‚ÄØguide what we choose to communicate, act upon, and how we behave. We share this every day with others simply by ‚Äúshowing up‚Äù. Our presence communicates something about us, our body language communicates more, and when we speak, we want to be understood for what we are trying to communicate. The internal dialogues we have with ourselves directly impact the people we are surrounded by and interact with on a daily basis.

We spend most of our days in our own head thinking about our appearances, how we feel about ourselves, and how we feel about others, muddled within our own current situations. When we say negative things about ourselves and our lives, there is a domino effect on our relationships. The people we interface with will subconsciously feel our negativity and may start mirroring and internalizing our negative behavior and thoughts as their own. This is true likewise for positive thoughts and emotions too.‚ÄØIt becomes contagious and the more people around us feeling a certain way heightens the pressure in our brains to emulate the same behavior and feelings.

It is natural to go about our days living in our own thoughts. However, if we can make an intention to smile more, make eye contact, say hello, and meaningfully connect with people, we can all benefit from this shared positivity.",4,0,0,4,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-the-world-is-activity-6809509400458379264-cA5i

Connections are egoless and through the heart. They are entirely accepting of the other and there are no obligations to act in a certain way in order for them to receive your love. 

In attached relationships, you only love the other if they act the way you like them to. You expect them to be there for you whenever you require and they need to do something in return for your affection. An example of an attached relationship is one you might have with your pet. You love that pet, but you expect it to act in a certain way. When it doesn‚Äôt, it upsets you.

A connection with something, on the other hand, is what you might have with a creature in nature. For instance, a butterfly you find yourself admiring as it floats past you. You appreciate it for what it is in that moment. You fully accept it with no judgement. You don‚Äôt care where it goes to next, or where it has been, and you don‚Äôt expect it to love you back.

I‚Äôm the first one to admit that it‚Äôs challenging not to be attached to your loved ones. Our emotions make it difficult not to be. You want the best for them. You want them to be safe. You want them to be happy. The problem is, do you really know what‚Äôs best for them? Do you really know what will make them happy? Are you sure what you want for them isn‚Äôt just what will make you happy?

The issues arise once you have an attachment to something and you depend on it to lift you up in some way. The relationship is always going really well or really badly, and your happiness depends on it to some extent. In other words, instead of making yourself happy, you are relying on an external source to do it for you. I‚Äôm sure it comes as no surprise that this type of happiness is not sustainable. 

Attachments drain your energy because you are always either trying to mould them into what you want, or you are changing yourself to please them. 

Having a connection with someone doesn‚Äôt actually take any energy. You simply accept them and they accept you without any judgement at all.",5,0,0,5,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_connections-and-attachments-connections-activity-6807286906464854016-f92C

Narcissism is extreme self-involvement to the degree that it makes a person ignore the needs of those around them. While everyone may show occasional narcissistic behavior, true narcissists frequently disregard others or their feelings. They also do not understand the effect that their behavior has on other people.

Lack of empathy, or the ability to feel how another person is feeling, is one of the hallmark characteristics of a narcissist. Narcissists lack the skill to make you feel seen, validated, understood, or accepted because they don‚Äôt grasp the concept of feelings. This inability to empathize, or even sympathize, is often the reason why many, if not all, narcissists‚Äô relationships eventually collapse, whether they‚Äôre romantic or not.

Those with high levels of narcissism may learn how to recognize their behavior with the right treatment. This can help to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. Historically, narcissists do not seek help since it doesn‚Äôt fit the self-image they have of themselves.

If you recognize that you‚Äôre in a relationship with a narcissist, you can change your dynamic in the relationship and challenge your partner to alter how they view you and your relationship.

If you recognize narcissism in yourself, you can begin to change your self-esteem to self-compassion. This means treating yourself with kindness instead of comparing yourself to others. You can stop trying to evaluate yourself against others, which can lower your need for praise and recognition.",4,0,0,4,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_all-about-me-narcissism-is-extreme-self-involvement-activity-6804760419694120960-fPa7

People who don't defend against unwanted emotions accept the things they cannot control (like thoughts and emotions). They don't treat emotions like anxiety as problems, and so those emotions cannot become problems.

Anxiety is still there; no one has a complete absence of anxiety. But if it‚Äôs accepted and experienced willingly, it doesn‚Äôt impair functioning and it doesn‚Äôt stop the person from doing anything.

If we set our goals more around changing behaviors in spite of anxiety, we do incidentally end up getting the anxiety reduction. But if we strive for anxiety reduction, we won't get it.

After my little brother died from a heroin overdose in 2015, I would often lie awake at night feeling a deep ache in my heart. Sadly, I couldn‚Äôt remember when it wasn‚Äôt there. The hurt rarely left me. Even if forgotten for brief moments, it always returned as a painful reminder that he was still gone.

Hurts that won‚Äôt heal are easily pushed into the shadows or met with empty words in our solution based society: ‚ÄúEverything happens for a reason‚Äù, ‚ÄúLook on the bright side‚Äù, or ‚ÄúTomorrow is a better day.‚Äù Such advice only deepens the hurt by down-playing and not acknowledging the profound loss.

Here‚Äôs my truth: Some hurts will always be a part of me. Losses may remind us that life is fragile, but they can also remind us that life is precious.

The following are a few ways that helped put my healing into overdrive:

1. Turn the hurt into a mission. Channel it by serving the Community. Supporting others also dealing with their own pain and loss builds empathy and connection.
2. Join support and therapy groups. Learning to share through vulnerability can be safe and freeing.
3. Keep growing. Grieving is important and necessary, but it doesn‚Äôt have to define us.

One-sided friendships and relationships hurt. They are emotionally and physically draining. You give until your cup is empty, and the other person acts as if they don‚Äôt even notice. It‚Äôs a heart-wrenching dynamic. You empty your cup for the other person, thinking their appreciation will fill it back up, only to find that recognition never comes. Instead, you are left empty, heart in hand, with no one to give it to.

But you are worth loving back. You are worth having your expectations met. Don‚Äôt settle for less than you deserve because you think nothing better is going to come along. Better is coming. What you deserve is coming.

Until then, you have to be that for yourself. Better to be that person for yourself rather than waste time chasing after the wrong heart. I had to prioritize myself before other people learned to prioritize me. My needs had to be met first before I could even consider the needs of another person.

If we want to be treated like the priority we are, we need to stop acting like an option. You are not a back up plan. And you are not an option. You are a priority, a privilege, and a prize.

Don‚Äôt ever settle for anyone who treats you any less.",6,0,0,6,0.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scott-weissman-62546a43_fill-your-cup-one-sided-friendships-and-activity-6794231549589016576-MByK

In the midst of this journey, the global pandemic shook up our plans; we took this new challenge as an opportunity and we embraced the time as a family.

It was pure joy for me to be present to help my kids navigate remote and in-person school while keeping them connected to their family and friends. It allowed me to focus on my health and my family while my husband was busy with work and pursing his MBA.

I am so grateful for this time; not only was I more available to connect with family and friends, but I accomplished my dream of building an e-commerce company.

While I stepped away from my career to enjoy my first retirement, I come back with fresh perspective and more energized than ever.

Today, I am excited to announce that I am back to doing what I love - helping develop the strategic people-elements necessary for success in a high growth environment, working alongside awesome people - my colleagues @ Sightline Payments

First season of sports ended and it left us with lessons to combat #covid19 as infection rates are at an all time high around the country.

1. Testing is crucial. The professional leagues test often. Clearly we will not be doing that but before you have family gatherings, test.  
2. Behave like you are in a bubble. Stay close with a few people, keep your network small and request collective participation.
3. Pandemic fatigue is real. Keep in mind you will get less cautious. See more people. Go to more places.
4. The biggest threats come from the unexpected. Most infections will happen when you don‚Äôt expect like having your meal in the cafeteria. #health #healthcare #wellness #fitness #medical #medicalbilling #personalinjury",1,0,0,1,0.00,text,"[""#covid19"", ""#health"", ""#healthcare"", ""#wellness"", ""#fitness"", ""#medical"", ""#medicalbilling"", ""#personalinjury""]",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_covid19-health-healthcare-activity-6735321351357313024-GRWn

1. Sell your current lien completely at a discounted rate, along with the right to collect the bill at settlement.
2. Sell your lien structured so that you can receive upfront payments, and still cash out at settlement. 
3. Partner with a finance firm to evaluate cases before service is performed, removing all risk. Sell the lien with negotiated rate. Get paid. 
4. Advance a set rate on claims based on credit worthiness, and historical performance while still sharing in on settlement.
