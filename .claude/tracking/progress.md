### October 27, 2025

**Materio MUI Light Mode Implementation - COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ Converted SortablePostsTable from CSS variables to MUI components
- ✅ Converted ProfileCard from CSS variables to MUI components
- ✅ Fixed MUI Grid deprecation warnings (migrated to v7 `size` prop API)
- ✅ Fixed insights page searchParams async access (Next.js 15 compliance)
- ✅ Applied light mode Materio colors throughout:
  - White card backgrounds (#FFFFFF)
  - Light gray page background (#F4F5FA)
  - Dark text (rgba(76, 78, 100, 0.87))
  - Vibrant accent colors (success.main, info.main, warning.main, etc.)
- Status: **Complete** - No MUI warnings, clean compilation, light mode consistent

**Key Components Updated**:
- `components/SortablePostsTable.tsx` - Full MUI Card/Table rewrite with light mode
- `components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Full MUI Card/Chip rewrite with light mode
- `app/page.tsx` - Grid v7 migration (4 instances)
- `components/ContentInsights.tsx` - Grid v7 migration (3 instances)
- `app/insights/page.tsx` - searchParams Promise type fix

**Testing Performed**:
- ✅ Clean dev server compilation (no warnings)
- ✅ Homepage renders with proper light mode colors
- ✅ All Grid components use new `size={{ xs, sm, lg }}` syntax
- ✅ No MUI deprecation warnings in console
- ✅ Insights page loads without searchParams errors

**Learnings**:
- MUI v7 uses `size` prop instead of individual `xs`, `sm`, `lg` props
- Next.js 15 requires awaiting searchParams before access
- CSS variables don't work well with theme-aware MUI components
- MUI sx prop with theme palette ensures proper light/dark mode support

**Article-Workspace Many-to-Many Relationship - COMPLETE** ✅
- ✅ Created `article_workspaces` junction table with indexes
- ✅ Migrated 105 existing articles to junction table
- ✅ Added 4 helper functions to `lib/intelligence.ts`:
  - `getAllWorkspacesForSource()` - Get all workspaces for a source
  - `linkArticleToWorkspace()` - Create article-workspace link
  - `getArticleWorkspaces()` - Get workspaces for an article
  - `unlinkArticleFromWorkspace()` - Remove workspace link
- ✅ Updated `getArticles()` query to use INNER JOIN with junction table
- ✅ Updated aggregator to link articles to multiple workspaces
- ✅ Updated signal detection to create signals per workspace
- ✅ Nullified old `workspace_id` column in news_articles
- ✅ Tested with 2 workspaces (Personal Injury, Gain Company)
- Status: **Production ready** - All tests passing, zero data duplication

**Key Results**:
- Same articles now appear in multiple workspaces (210 links for 105 articles)
- No data duplication (single article in news_articles table)
- Sources assigned to multiple workspaces work correctly
- Performance: Minimal impact (small junction table with good indexes)

**Testing Performed**:
- ✅ Database migration (105 rows migrated successfully)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (no errors related to changes)
- ✅ API endpoint testing (workspaces 3, 6, no filter all working)
- ✅ Query performance verification (DISTINCT + JOIN efficient)
- ✅ Data integrity checks (210 links = 105 articles × 2 workspaces)
- ✅ Many-to-many verification (same article ID in both workspaces)

**Documentation**:
- Created `docs/WORKSPACE-MANY-TO-MANY-IMPLEMENTATION.md` with full details
- Migration script: `migrations/005_article_workspaces_many_to_many.sql`

**Learnings**:
- Junction tables provide flexibility without duplication
- Clean rebuilds essential when updating complex queries
- INNER JOIN with DISTINCT prevents duplicate rows
- Nullifying old columns maintains backward compatibility

### October 25, 2025

- ✅ Created folder structure (`.claude/tracking/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/docs/`)
- ✅ Moved existing documentation to organized structure
- ✅ Created `progress.md` with comprehensive template and git history
- ✅ Created `decisions.md` with 12 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- ✅ Created `bugs.md` with known issues and resolution tracking
- ✅ Created 5 sub-agent configuration files:
  - `coordinator.md` - Lead agent for task orchestration
  - `web-developer.md` - Frontend/backend development specialist
  - `database-architect.md` - Database design and optimization specialist
  - `api-designer.md` - API endpoint and integration specialist
  - `devops-engineer.md` - Deployment and infrastructure specialist
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with 4 new Ultrathink sections:
  - Context Management Best Practices
  - Structured Note-Taking Protocol
  - Sub-Agent Architecture guidelines
  - Memory Tool Instructions
- Status: **Full implementation complete** - All context engineering practices operational

**Key Deliverables**:
- 3 structured tracking files (progress.md, decisions.md, bugs.md)
- 5 specialized sub-agent configurations
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with Ultrathink methodology (v1.0.0)
- Organized documentation structure (.claude/ folder hierarchy)

**Benefits**:
- Better context management for long development sessions
- Persistent project memory across sessions
- Specialized agents for complex multi-domain tasks
- Structured note-taking prevents information loss

### October 2025 (Previous Work)

- Implemented navigation persistence across pages (WorkspaceAwareNav component)
- Added team profile type with purple badges (👥 icon)
- Implemented workspace batch scraping (6 profiles in parallel)
- Added workspace-aware profile adding with pre-selection
- Status: Production ready, all features tested

**TypeScript Fixes**
- Fixed all TypeScript type errors with proper assertions (`3b38345`)
- Removed all `any` types for better type safety (`156dfd9`)
- Status: Build passing, no type errors

## 🎓 Learnings & Best Practices

### Recent Insights

**Context Management (Oct 25, 2025)**
- Discovered Ultrathink methodology for better AI agent reliability
- Learned importance of proactive compaction at 70-80% capacity
- Understanding value of structured note-taking for long-term projects

**Workspace Architecture (Oct 2025)**
- URL params should be source of truth for UI state
- Navigation components must preserve query parameters
- Batch operations significantly improve UX (6x faster scraping)

**TypeScript Hygiene (Oct 2025)**
- Proper type assertions > `any` types
- Type safety catches bugs early
- Build-time type checking essential

### Patterns That Work Well

1. **File-based memory system** - CLAUDE.md as project constitution
2. **Server Components by default** - Only use client components when needed
3. **Database functions in lib/db.ts** - Centralized data access
4. **Workspace filtering pattern** - URL-driven, not localStorage
5. **Batch operations** - Better UX and performance
