Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-17,"I learned this the hard way: If you don't control the conversation structure, the conversation controls you.

Used to be, I'd jump on calls and just see where things went. Sometimes good, usually messy.

Now I start every important call the same way:

""Here's what I'm hoping to accomplish today: 

I want to understand your current Lien process and see if there's a way we can help streamline it. 

I'll ask some questions about how things work now, share what I've seen work for similar practices, and by the end we'll both know if it makes sense to keep talking. 

Sounds good?""

Three sentences. Sets the whole tone.

Why does this work? Because in the PI world, everyone's busy. Attorneys are juggling cases. Providers are seeing patients. Nobody has time for rambling sales calls.

When you're clear about the purpose upfront, people relax. They know what to expect.

This isn't a sales trick - it's just respect for people's time.

And honestly, it helps me too. When I know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, I ask better questions and give better answers.

I picked this up after sitting through too many calls that went nowhere because nobody knew what we were actually trying to figure out.

Structure creates clarity. Clarity builds trust. Trust leads to partnerships.

How do you structure important conversations? I'm always looking for better ways to do this.",,,,,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_i-learned-this-the-hard-way-if-you-dont-activity-7384966480582373377-JRxQ,Gain Company
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-16,"The ‚ÄúPE in Accounting‚Äù nightmare that never was...
On the surface, it looked like the moment the doomsayers had warned about. 
A Big 6 firm under pressure. Layoffs. 
And Apollo‚Äôs name in the debt documents.

For many, it felt like the proof point had finally arrived ‚Äî 
that private equity had begun to inflict irreversible damage on accounting firms.

Except, the facts don‚Äôt hold. It wasn't PE at all.

BDO financed its ESOP with a $1.3B private-credit facility from Apollo. 
Their CEO said Apollo ‚Äútook no ownership stake and was acting like a bank.‚Äù 
Ownership stayed with CPAs and employees. 
No board seats. No management control.

That doesn't make it any less painful. 
People lost jobs. Teams were disrupted. Careers were shaken. 
But this wasn‚Äôt PE pulling the strings ‚Äî it was the consequence of leverage and timing.

And that difference matters. 
If we can‚Äôt tell credit from control, 
we‚Äôll keep mistaking every capital experiment for an apocalypse.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-16,"Let me tell you about the moment I realized we had a trust problem in this industry.

I was sitting in a lawyer's office in Atlanta. Great guy, been doing PI for 20 years.

He tells me: ""Eliezer, I've got three cases stuck with my current funder. No updates in two weeks. My clients are asking questions I can't answer.""
That hit me hard.

This wasn't about funding speed or rates. It was about trust.

Here's what happens when funding communication breaks down:

The attorney can't manage client expectations. The provider doesn't know when they'll get paid. The patient starts wondering if their care team is actually coordinated.

Everyone loses confidence.

I've seen this pattern hundreds of times over 15 years. Strong case, good care, but the funding gets stuck in some black box for weeks with no explanation.
The problem isn't usually the money - it's the silence.

So here's what we changed: Every case gets regular updates. Every provider knows exactly when payment hits. Every attorney has my direct number.
Is this more work for us? Absolutely. But it's the right work.

Because when you're dealing with people's medical care and legal recovery, trust isn't optional. It's everything.

I learned this the hard way early in my career. I thought being busy meant I was being productive. Wrong. Being responsive means you're being professional.

Now when lawyers call me, they get straight answers. When providers need updates, they get real timelines. When things go sideways (they always do sometimes), everyone knows what's happening and why.

This isn't about our process being perfect - it's about our communication being honest.

What's your biggest frustration with funding communication? I bet there's a way to fix it.",1,1,,2,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_let-me-tell-you-about-the-moment-i-realized-activity-7384604057929199616-Jrdz,Gain Company
Saul Mateos,saulmateos,2025-10-16,"AI won‚Äôt replace great CFOs. It will replace the ones who don‚Äôt build systems.

Most CFOs talk about AI like it‚Äôs a concept.
For me, it‚Äôs a workflow.

A few weeks ago, I sat with Nicolas Boucher to walk through how I actually use AI in finance not theory, but daily practice.

Here‚Äôs what that looks like üëá

‚Üí Every morning, an AI project preps me before meetings.
It pulls context from my calendar, emails, and notes so I walk into every call knowing what matters most.

‚Üí I run multiple AIs in parallel.
While I‚Äôm building models, one is drafting insights.
While I‚Äôm in meetings, another is summarizing transcripts.
Work happens while I work.

‚Üí Reporting is fully automated.
AI builds dashboards, flags anomalies, and generates the first draft of commentary, freeing my team to focus on decisions, not decks.

‚Üí For pitch decks, I built a full chain.
Claude for structure.
Deep Research for validation.
GenSpark for polish.
What used to take two days now takes two hours.

But here‚Äôs what matters most.
AI isn‚Äôt about using tools. It‚Äôs about designing systems.
If you stack ten platforms without purpose, you create noise, not leverage.

So I‚Äôve learned a few rules.
‚Üí Orchestrate workflows, not tools.
‚Üí Feed AI consistent context, not perfect data.
‚Üí Build feedback loops for everything you do.

AI won‚Äôt replace CFOs.
But it will replace analysts, managers, and leaders who don‚Äôt adapt.

The ones who build systems will move faster.
The ones who don‚Äôt will get left behind.

Fast.

For decades, growth only mattered if efficiency improved.
Now, growth itself can be a lever.

Ownership isn‚Äôt equal anymore.
Capital has its own kind of leverage.
And who benefits from growth depends on how the firm is financed ‚Äî

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-15,"A doctor called me yesterday asking why his lien payment took 6 months when the case settled 4 months ago.

Good question. Here's what actually happened:

Law firm ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí Funding company ‚Üí Back office ‚Üí Payment processor ‚Üí Doctor

Five handoffs. Five opportunities for something to get stuck. Five people who aren't really talking to each other.

I've seen this story play out hundreds of times over the past 15 years.

Patient needs surgery. Case is solid. Lawyer does great work. But the money gets lost in some broker's pipeline for months because nobody wants to take responsibility for the delay.

That's not just inefficient - it's wrong.

Here's what I learned from watching too many of these situations: The more people involved in the funding process, the more places things can break down.

So we built our process differently. When we fund a case, it's a straight line:

Attorney calls me ‚Üí We review the case ‚Üí Money moves ‚Üí Provider gets paid
No broker fees. No middleman markups. No wondering who to call when something goes sideways.

Is our process perfect? No. But it's honest. And when problems come up (they always do), there's one person to call - usually me.

I know this sounds like I'm pitching our service, but here's the real talk: I've seen too many strong cases get derailed by funding delays that had nothing to do with the case itself.

After visiting 200+ law firms, the #1 complaint I hear isn't about rates or terms. It's about communication.

""Where's my funding?"" ""When will the provider get paid?"" ""Why can't anyone give me a straight answer?""

Direct funding fixes this because there's nowhere for information to hide.

Saul Mateos,saulmateos,2025-10-14,"The CFO's real job isn't to predict, it's to prepare.

Every board deck wants certainty.

Every forecast pretends to have it.

But here's the truth most people won't say out loud:

No one can predict what's coming.
Not the markets.
Not the customers.
Not even your best model.

I learned that the hard way.

At one company, we had the ""perfect"" capital plan.
Everything lined up demand, margins, cash runway.

Then Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.
Or the IPO market shut down.
Or interest rates doubled.
Or that ""certain"" deal didn't close.

Pick your crisis. They all have the same lesson:

In 72 hours, your perfect plan becomes useless.

That's when I stopped obsessing over precision.
And started focusing on resilience.

Because the CFO's real job isn't to say what will happen 
It's to make sure the company can survive what does.

Preparation beats prediction every time.

You can't control the next downturn,
But you can control your cash discipline.

You can't forecast every customer delay,
But you can model how long you last if revenue slips.

You can't plan for every surprise,
But you can build a balance sheet that absorbs one.

The best CFOs don't sell certainty 
They build systems that bend before they break.

They ask harder questions:

What happens if growth slows 30%?

How long can we sustain this burn?

Which levers buy us time to adjust?

A great forecast gives you a roadmap.
But preparation gives you a parachute.

And when things change and they always do 
It's the parachute that saves the company, not the roadmap.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-10-13,"My 6 AI plays to cut software waste
üëâ Let me show some of them live this Thursday: https://vrtc.io/48jirtn

(made free thanks to Vertice sponsoring it)

Imagine you are the CFO and you see this:
SaaS prices up 11%, but 66% of seats sit idle
Renewal was last week

How would you react?

I'm sure you don't want this to happen again.

This is why we need a repeatable way to find shelfware fast


This is what we will discuss this Thursday.

Here are already some examples on how you can use AI:

1. Use GenAI to surface your true KPIs
Ask an AI model with your raw data: ‚ÄúWhich 10 KPIs best represent software spend health‚Äîand why?‚Äù It spots board-level metrics (logins per paid seat, cost per active user, renewal risk cohorts

2. Run cohort analysis in minutes, not days
Segment by department and show 30/60/90-day activity vs. seats and cost; flag cohorts where activity falls below 5%. Finance teams report 2‚Äì8 hours; AI does the first pass in ~2 minutes

3. Automate the data mess
Prompt AI to write scripts (Google Apps Script/Office Script/VBA) to combine tabs, standardize vendor names/SSO IDs, and keep only needed columns. No more manual cleanup

4. Ask AI: ‚ÄúWhat are 100 things I don‚Äôt know but should?‚Äù
Drop in a billing summary or describe your stack. You‚Äôll uncover blind spots‚ÄîSSO mismatches, duplicate tools, zombie seats, or teams paying outside procurement

5. Invest in AI-native finance tools
Auto-categorize transactions, flag anomalies, draft entries, and connect ERP/AP/SSO/vendor exports so usage, billing, and renewals flow into one view

6. Pull data via API‚Äîwith AI as your helper
Have AI draft a Python script to pull last-login and active-seat counts from Okta, Zoom, Atlassian, or M365; then join across apps. Same pattern for Salesforce renewals.

Your team can find and kill shelfware fast by pairing finance judgment with small AI workflows
Cleaner data, stronger negotiations, less waste‚Äîwithout waiting on engineering

For a while, the math worked beautifully: 
Buy firms cheap, consolidate, sell at a higher multiple.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-10,"I used to run the worst team meetings.

Seriously. I'd cram everything into one hour: case updates, strategy, problems, wins. Everyone would leave confused about what they were supposed to do next.

Then one of my team members pulled me aside and said, ""Eliezer, these meetings are all over the place. Can we focus on one thing at a time?""

She was right. So we split our meetings into two types:

Operations meetings: Where are cases stuck? What docs are missing? Who needs to follow up on what?

Strategy meetings: What's working across our client base? Where should we invest more time? How do we solve bigger problems?

This small change made a huge difference.

The ops meetings became crisp and actionable. The strategy meetings gave us space to actually think, not just react.

Here's what I learned: In the PI servicing world, urgency is constant. There's always a case that needs attention, a payment that's delayed, a client who needs an update.

But if you let urgency drive everything, you never get ahead of problems. You just chase them.

Now our team knows: Operations meetings for putting out fires. Strategy meetings for preventing them.

The ops stuff still gets handled - just in its own time and space. And the strategic thinking actually happens instead of getting buried under ""Hey, quick question about this case...""

It's not rocket science, but it works.

EBITDA explained to Kids
Explanations for kids... and adults!

üí∞ What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


‚ùóÔ∏è Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It‚Äôs like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


üí∏ How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


üëßüèº Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


üîº EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don‚Äôt take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-09,"I used to be that rep who jumped straight into our rates and terms.

You know the type - walks into your office and immediately starts explaining features you didn't ask about. Talks past what's actually keeping you up at night.

I cringe thinking about those early meetings.

Here's what changed everything for me: I stopped trying to impress people with what we do and started asking what's actually broken.

After 15 years of visiting law firms and medical practices, I've learned that the best conversations start with one simple question:

""What made you take this meeting today?""

That's it. No agenda. No pitch deck. Just genuine curiosity about what prompted them to explore help.

The answers tell you everything:

- ""We're spending 20 hours a week chasing payments that should be automatic.""
- ""I've got strong cases sitting in limbo because I can't get straight answers from my current funding partner.""
- ""My office manager is drowning in paperwork from three different lien companies.""

Once I understand the real problem, I can figure out if we can actually help. And if we can't? I tell them honestly and point them toward someone who can.

This isn't about having perfect questions. It's about shutting up and listening.
Because here's the thing - every practice has different pain points. If I'm not asking the right questions, I'm just another vendor making noise.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-10-09,"Most policymakers think consumer legal funding means controlling lawsuits.
It doesn't. It's explicitly banned.

Every state that regulates consumer legal funding has the same rule: funders can't influence litigation. No control over strategy. No settlement vetoes. No fee-sharing.

Why?

Because the attorney-client relationship is the foundation of the justice system.
Consumer legal funding covers rent, food, utilities‚Äînot discovery budgets or expert witnesses.

ARC's (The Alliance for Responsible Consumer Legal Funding) latest article  breaks this down: the statutes, the ethics rules, the market realities.

When legislators lump consumer advances with commercial litigation deals, they write rules that choke off access.

Injured people facing eviction. Families pressured into early, low-value settlements. People who can't afford to wait for fairness.

If you're drafting legislation‚Äîthis clarity matters.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-10-09,"Forget the $1M AI PhDs. Regular professionals who think ""AI-first"" are commanding serious premiums.

You feel it every week.

The WSJ reports AI-native engineers making $260K base vs $180K for traditional devs. That's a 44% premium for changing HOW you think, not WHAT you know.

And it's spreading beyond engineering.

I'm seeing AI-native premiums everywhere:

‚Üí Finance teams who automate reporting
‚Üí Marketing teams who prompt instead of brief
‚Üí Sales ops who build AI-powered workflows

Traditional FP&A: 5 days of Excel gymnastics
AI-native FP&A: Python + GPT-4 for variance analysis = 4 hours

Same CPA. Dramatically different value.

The brutal truth: Companies aren't paying for AI certifications. They're paying for people who ship results 5x faster because they see AI as their co-pilot, not their competition.

Which GenAI should you actually use‚ÄîChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That‚Äôs a question I get a lot

This is why I created this guide for you,
Here‚Äôs my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You‚Äôre an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you‚Äôre a small business‚Äîit has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot‚Äôs most underrated feature‚Äîand the main reason to choose it if you‚Äôre a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That‚Äôs a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft‚Äôs security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it‚Äôs tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails‚Äîit works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it‚Äôs basic‚Äîtoo much at stake with the world‚Äôs number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you‚Äôll never use email the old way!

Here's how to go from messy data to a dynamic, presentation-ready model in minutes:

1. Automate Your Month-End Close with Scripts
Still copy-pasting from multiple files into spreadsheets?

Try this instead:
Beginner:
Use Google Apps Script to clean & format data in Google Sheets
Ask ChatGPT to write the script

Advanced:
Use Python + script to merge multiple CSVs
Automatically generate a ready-to-use report
Cuts out hours of repetitive work


2. Build Financial Models with AI

All you need is:
Your P&L in CSV
ChatGPT
Prompt example:
‚ÄúI am a CFO of a manufacturing company.
 I need to prepare a 5 year strategic plan with 3 scenarios:
 1- Base (sales increase by 3% per year, margin constant, cost increase by 2%)
 2- Add a gradual expansion to the US
 3- Pessimistic: -2% in sales volume year after year, margin % decrease by 1% year after year and other cost decrease only 1% year after year
Make this financial model with formulas and make sure i can change the variable with an assumption sheet""

Result:
A structured model with revenue, margin, cost variables
Assumptions tab to tweak inputs
Excel-ready, boardroom-approved


3. Turn Models into Dynamic Slide Decks

In ChatGPT‚Äôs Canvas Mode:
 Ask:
‚ÄúNow build a dynamic slide deck in html to present the different scenarios based on the model you build
 I want to be able to change some assumptions in the slide deck and also have a graph to compare the 3 scenarios (revenue, margin, ebit)‚Äù

Why this matters:
You can change assumptions live during meetings
You can compare base vs. pessimistic vs. expansion models
And most importantly: you can show leadership you‚Äôre ready for any outcome

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-10-02,"Finance teams that understand the business beat teams that understand accounting.

You can learn accounting reading a book (or taking online courses).
Despite what they tell you in a MBA, you can't learn business judgment in a class room.

The accounting-focused finance team:
‚Üí Knows every journal entry
‚Üí Closes books perfectly on time
‚Üí Builds flawless variance reports
‚Üí Follows every compliance requirement

The business-focused finance team:
‚Üí Knows why gross margins dropped
‚Üí Predicts cash flow issues before they hit
‚Üí Builds models that drive actual decisions
‚Üí Partners with sales on deal structure

Guess which one gets invited to strategy meetings?

The difference shows up everywhere:

Accounting mindset: ""Revenue was $2.1M, up 8% from last month.""
Business mindset: ""We‚Äôre growing, but deal sizes are shrinking. Here‚Äôs why that matters for Q4.""

Accounting mindset: ""Working capital increased by $300K.""
Business mindset: ""We‚Äôre collecting slower and inventory is building. Cash will be tight in 60 days.""

Accounting mindset: ""Gross margin variance was unfavorable by 200 basis points.""
Business mindset: ""Our biggest customer is squeezing prices. We need to diversify or restructure deals.""

The career impact is brutal:

Finance people who only speak accounting stay in finance.
Finance people who speak business become business leaders.

Your technical skills get you hired.
Your business understanding gets you promoted.

The shift starts with one question:
Instead of ""What happened?"" ask ""Why does this matter?""

Every number tells a business story.
Your job isn‚Äôt just to calculate it.
It‚Äôs to translate it.

But when cash became urgent, nobody knew which levers to pull
So I spent hours breaking it down:

-What drives cash in/out beyond profit
-Which KPIs actually matter
-Small fixes that create breathing room

I‚Äôve collected these (and more) into a cheatsheet you can use: https://lnkd.in/eMZXUffh

It‚Äôs a one-stop reference with:
Essential finance formulas and KPIs
Accounting rules and principles
Working capital, cash flow, and valuation guides
Time value of money shortcuts you can apply instantly

Too many companies suffocate because they don‚Äôt manage their Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

The CCC shows how long it takes to turn investments in inventory and other assets into cash from sales

The formula is simple:
CCC = DIO + DSO ‚Äì DPO

Why it matters:
- Traces the full lifecycle of cash
- Enhances cash flow by optimizing DIO, DSO, or DPO
- Highlights inefficiencies in inventory, receivables, and payables

5 ways to optimize your Cash Conversion Cycle:
1. Implement JIT Inventory ‚Äì reduce excess stock, improve turnover
2. Negotiate Longer Payment Terms ‚Äì extend payables without penalties
3. Streamline invoicing ‚Äì expedite collections, offer early payment discounts
4. Build a strong Cash Culture ‚Äì involve all departments in optimizing cash
5. Use Advanced Forecasting Tools ‚Äì predict demand accurately, align inventory

Cash isn‚Äôt just a number on a balance sheet‚Äîit‚Äôs the engine that keeps your business alive and growing

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-10-01,"Most policymakers think consumer legal funding means controlling lawsuits.
It doesn't. It's explicitly banned.

Every state that regulates consumer legal funding has the same rule: funders can't influence litigation. No control over strategy. No settlement vetoes. No fee-sharing.

Why?

Because the attorney-client relationship is the foundation of the justice system.
Consumer legal funding covers rent, food, utilities‚Äînot discovery budgets or expert witnesses.

Eric Schuller breaks this down in his new piece for Legal Funding Journal: the statutes, the ethics rules, the market realities.

Consumer Legal Funding: Funding Lives, Not Litigation.

When legislators lump consumer advances with commercial litigation deals, they write rules that choke off access.

Injured people facing eviction. Families pressured into early, low-value settlements. People who can't afford to wait for fairness.

If you're drafting legislation‚Äîthis clarity matters.

Thanks to The Alliance for Responsible Consumer Legal Funding (ARC) for continuing to educate on these distinctions.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-01,"Most finance leaders at advisory firms only ever live in one universe.
üåé Front office ‚Äî sourcing deals, selling scopes, sitting across from a PE CFO. 
üåç Back office ‚Äî closing the books, chasing timesheets, building dashboards no one reads.

I‚Äôve lived in both.

I‚Äôve sourced and sold $500k engagements to the ùóØùó∂ùó¥ùó¥ùó≤ùòÄùòÅ ùó£ùóò ùó≥ùó∂ùóøùó∫ùòÄ ùó∂ùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùòÑùóºùóøùóπùó±. 
I‚Äôve built BI models that became the backbone of $200M+ growth stories. 
I‚Äôve sat across the table from CFOs, boards, and sponsors ‚Äî and closed.

And I‚Äôve also been on the other side, deep in the trenches: 
‚Üí Writing automations to ping late timesheet offenders 
‚Üí Building reporting packages from scratch 
‚Üí Forecasting headcount and utilization week by week

Here‚Äôs the kicker: the BD and execution leads I nagged internally let me do it‚Ä¶ because they‚Äôd already seen me deliver in their universe.

That credibility ‚Äî that ability to pierce the veil between front and back office ‚Äî is the glue most firms don‚Äôt have.

And when you don‚Äôt?
‚Ä¢ Engagement Letters go out with baked-in margin risk
‚Ä¢ Delivery runs without profitability guardrails
‚Ä¢ Finance becomes a scorekeeper instead of a growth driver

My finance function assessments are designed to fix this. 
Because I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúreview finance,"" and give you the tablestakes:
‚Ä¢ Recommend shorter close timelines
‚Ä¢ Tell you what ""best-in-class"" AR days outstanding looks like
‚Ä¢ Give you a KPI dump (utilization, realization, revenue per FTE, etc...) 

I also rewire finance's role across the entire deal cycle.
‚Ä¢ Pursuit teams armed with the knowledge to confidently scope engagements based on what's worked
‚Ä¢ AR teams armed to promptly invoice: both to improve collection timing and to avoid clients receiving unexpectedly large bills
‚Ä¢ FP&A teams armed with live data to flag margin compression and write-off risk before the Engagement Letter even goes out

For much, much less than six figures.

Can your finance function deliver on all that? If not, you're losing out on opportunities before the deal even starts.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-30,"The CFO as risk architect

Most people think the CFO‚Äôs job is to manage money.
Cash. Budgets. Forecasts. Reporting.

But the best CFOs do something bigger.
They design how the company absorbs and responds to risk.

Because risk isn‚Äôt a single event.
It‚Äôs constant.
Revenue concentration.
Market downturns.
Delayed fundraising.
Regulatory changes.
Even a single bad hire.

And here‚Äôs the truth:
Most finance teams only react when risk shows up.
By then, it‚Äôs too late.

The companies that endure are built differently.
They don‚Äôt just plan for growth.
They plan for turbulence.

That‚Äôs what risk architecture looks like.

‚Üí Scenario planning that doesn‚Äôt just model upside, but survival.
What happens if revenue drops 20%? What if fundraising takes 6 months longer?

‚Üí Systems that protect cash before it‚Äôs needed.
Contracts structured for flexibility. Vendor terms that buy time. Reserves that buy options.

‚Üí Spend that‚Äôs tied to milestones, not just bank balance.
Because hiring 20 people before the model proves out isn‚Äôt strategy it‚Äôs hope.

‚Üí Communication loops that make risk visible early.
Dashboards that surface weak signals. Narratives that show the trade-offs clearly to the board.

When it works, the company doesn‚Äôt just survive shocks.
It absorbs them.
It adapts.
It moves faster than competitors who are still scrambling for answers.

That‚Äôs what great CFOs actually do.
Not just stewards of money.
Architects of resilience.

Because in the end, capital is finite.
But risk never runs out.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-30,"You think your GTM plan for FP&A advisory is about BD. 
It‚Äôs not. 
It‚Äôs about talent. It‚Äôs about service offerings. It‚Äôs about mindset.

It‚Äôs about building a new discipline from the ground up.

Most firms try to ‚Äúupskill‚Äù their existing CAS and advisory staff. 
But compliance and bookkeeping talent can‚Äôt be repurposed into Strategic FP&A.

Because accounting is about ùò§ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò¢ùò™ùòØùòµùò∫. 
Footing and cross-footing until every number reconciles. That discipline matters. It‚Äôs the foundation FP&A builds on.

To move from ‚Äúthe books are clean‚Äù to ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how we grow.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why FP&A advisory isn‚Äôt an extension of #CAS. 
It‚Äôs a new service line altogether. 
And it requires a new talent pool to get it right.

Accountants and consultants? We get the Monday Mandatories.

Early in my career, if my timesheet was late three weeks in a year, my bonus got docked. I still had that pit in my stomach two years later ‚Äî even after I‚Äôd left the role.

Later, I ran the analytics on $200M of billable hours a year. My email address was the one that pinged 1,000+ people if they were even a day late submitting. (Automated, of course ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt matter. I was that guy in their inbox.)

And here‚Äôs the bigger issue: hours aren‚Äôt just painful ‚Äî they‚Äôre often mismanaged.

‚Ä¢¬†Leaders inflate hours to hit budget
‚Ä¢¬†Managers suppress hours to cover bad scoping

Everyone in professional services has seen these games. And none of them measure what actually matters. Hours measure cost. They don‚Äôt measure value.

Now, with private equity demanding scale and AI automating the grunt work that filled timesheets, the shift away from hours isn‚Äôt optional. It‚Äôs inevitable. Firms that cling to hourly billing will be left behind.

‚Ä¢ Speed under pressure

2Ô∏è‚É£ Early Alignment with PE (2010‚Äì15): Firms positioned themselves as the natural partner to sponsors (CrossCountry Consulting and others).
3Ô∏è‚É£ New Entrants & Scaling (2016‚Äì19): A wave of boutiques formed, and the market began to professionalize (E78, Virtas Partners and others).

Limited seats!

‚Äî

Some adults still nod at EBITDA... without fully getting it 

Let‚Äôs fix that ‚Äî with lemonade 

Explanation for kids... and adults!

üí∞ What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


‚ùóÔ∏è Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It‚Äôs like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


üí∏ How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


üëßüèº Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


üîº EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don‚Äôt take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

‚Äî

But that‚Äôs just the start‚Ä¶

Modern CFOs don‚Äôt just know EBITDA ‚Äî they use AI for:

- Financial Analysis 
- Automation
- Road map creation

Which I will all demonstrate in my ""How to become an AI CFO"" webinar

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-09-24,"Just finished a training session for a finance team on how to use AI for Finance

Here‚Äôs what we covered:

First I asked them how they were using AI

Most of them were only using AI for emails, research, and a little help with formulas

Not one was really leveraging AI on the core Finance tasks:
- Financial Analysis
- Reporting
- Automation

So I spent 2 hours walking them through exactly these 3 areas

Let me share with you what I taught them:

First part: Financial Analysis
I started asking them which model is best for financial analysis?

Only a few people knew this, but the best ones are: ChatGPT 5 in Thinking Mode, Copilot Analyzer Agent, and for Gemini the 2.5 Pro model.

Then I showed them the biggest mistake to avoid:
I see too many people just asking AI to ‚Äúanalyze your file‚Äù with no instructions
Instead, I gave them my 5-step framework:
1) Check consistency of data (my old auditor reflex).
2) Ask AI which analyses to perform: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive. (This forces it to be ambitious)
3) Run the actual calculations and show the work
4) Prepare visuals/graphs
5) Write commentary like a seasoned CFO
Try this and you will see much better results!!


Second part: Reporting
Here‚Äôs the trick almost nobody knows: the Canvas function in ChatGPT & Gemini. (Not Canva, the design tool. I mean Canvas, hidden under the tools icon in your chat box)

With Canvas, you can build dynamic slides and models
Example: a sensitivity analysis that instantly updates as you tweak assumptions

This is the part that usually gets jaws to drop.

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a game-changer:
You type what you want, and it literally codes a dynamic reporting for you
It's like combining a deck of slides + a BI dashboard
All done in a few minutes

You can tweak assumptions in real-time and the slides update instantly

So instead of walking into a meeting with a static Excel full of tables‚Ä¶
You show up with an interactive model that answers ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions on the spot
Cool right?


Third part: Automation
This part really excited them (because of the time saving opportunities!)

But most finance folks mix up AI and automation
They‚Äôre not the same:
Automation = stable, repeatable process (like an Excel formula or an Outlook rule)
AI = flexible, adaptive responses (but also always changing!)

Finance needs automation first, not AI

But the main problem: most finance people can‚Äôt code

But now AI writes the scripts for you
I demoed them how to:
- Consolidate multiple files into one automatically
- Clean and format data in seconds

All with scripts they can keep reusing. No AI needed after ;)


Finally I wrapped up with my best tip: how to create CustomGPTs / Copilot Agents using a framework I only share with clients and my AI Finance Club.


You might want to learn this for yourself as well.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-24,"Everyone talks about product-market fit. Nobody talks about communication-market fit.

But if you‚Äôve ever built anything with a team‚Äîyou feel the difference.

When I look back at the fastest-moving partnerships we‚Äôve built at Gain‚Äîproviders, firms, funders‚Äîthere‚Äôs one thing they all had in common:

Response speed wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfast.‚Äù It was immediate.
Not just for ego.
Not just to look sharp.

But because the work mattered enough to not sit in limbo.

The providers who‚Äôve scaled with us?
They move on funding requests in hours, not days.

The firms who close more cases?
They don‚Äôt ghost paperwork for 10 days and blame ‚Äúbacklog.‚Äù

The top teams I‚Äôve worked with over the years‚Äî
they treat momentum like an asset.
Not hustle.
Not 24/7 Slack addiction.
But a shared rhythm.
Because when communication moves fast, trust compounds.
And when trust compounds, so does output.

So if you‚Äôre wondering why your team feels stuck, bloated, or scattered‚Äî
don‚Äôt just look at tools.

Look at timing.
Clarity doesn‚Äôt wait. Neither should replies.

The WSJ just ran a piece on Wall Street‚Äôs hiring spree ‚Äî JPMorgan alone added 100+ MDs this year as M&A and IPO markets heat up. Other top banks are doing the same. Talent is the story. But so is cyclicality.

What does it mean for Office of the CFO advisory?

üîπ Talent wars are real
Bankers get poached for their relationships, deal reps, and boardroom access. OCFO firms face the same fight. The best advisors bring not just modeling and reporting skills, but trust with sponsors and operators. That‚Äôs scarce, and it‚Äôs where firms differentiate.

üîπ Cycle neutrality has limits

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-23,"Every #accounting firm in the $30‚Äì70M range is facing the same question:
Are we structurally ready to grow ‚Äî no matter which capital path we take?

Aprio‚Äôs latest move ‚Äî acquiring Mize CPAs Inc. ($47M, 300+ people) and Prism ($1.8B AUM) ‚Äî shows where the bar is being set. Backed by #PE, they‚Äôre building a full-stack platform: tax, advisory, payroll, wealth, even law.

But here‚Äôs the takeaway for regional firms:
üëâ The disciplines that PE sponsors insist on aren‚Äôt about making life harder. They‚Äôre the same disciplines that unlock growth while independent.

‚Üí¬†Centralized decision-making across partners and service lines.
‚Üí¬†Bullet-proof KPIs ‚Äî sliceable by client, industry, partner, service.
‚Üí¬†Real-time insights so you can course-correct before a board (or banker) ever asks.
‚Üí¬†Integrated systems so your data isn‚Äôt fighting itself.

PE pushes this because they‚Äôve made it work. Not because they want to make your finance team miserable.
But in today‚Äôs market, every firm ‚Äî independent, debt-financed, or PE-backed ‚Äî needs these tools to grow.

The real risk isn‚Äôt missing a deal.

We could respond in hours ‚Äî because we had already built the reporting cube long before bankers showed up.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-22,"Some of the best teams I‚Äôve worked with didn‚Äôt share the same background.
They didn‚Äôt grow up in the same country.
They didn‚Äôt train in the same discipline.
They didn‚Äôt look at problems the same way.

And that‚Äôs exactly why they outperformed.

Over my career, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working with teams across more than 14 countries
Finance specialists in Latin America.
Tech innovators in Europe.
Cross-functional teams in the U.S. and Asia.

Different cultures. Different lenses. Different ways of thinking.
What I saw again and again is that diverse teams don‚Äôt just work differently.
They work better.

They make stronger decisions.
Blind spots get challenged earlier.
Assumptions don‚Äôt go unchecked.
And the result is a solution that stands up under pressure.

They innovate faster.
Some of the best ideas I‚Äôve seen came from people ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the expected domain.
A marketer at Coca-Cola influenced how I built a finance model.
A data scientist in SaaS reshaped how I thought about forecasting.
Cross-pollination creates breakthroughs.

And they build resilience.
In startups especially, volatility is constant.
Multicultural and cross-functional teams bring more problem-solving tools to the table.
They don‚Äôt just react differently, they anticipate differently.
That makes them harder to break when uncertainty hits.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-22,"You treat a patient today.

But the money? 

It might not arrive for 6, 12, or even 18 months.

That‚Äôs not bad luck‚Äîit‚Äôs a systems issue.

And it‚Äôs one of the biggest risks in lien-backed care.

Most practices I speak with still track liens in spreadsheets, chase attorneys manually, and cross their fingers for payment.

Meanwhile:

- High-value claims go cold

- Staff burn out on follow-ups

- Collections remain unpredictable

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

Revenue isn‚Äôt just lost to denials‚Äîit‚Äôs lost to disorganization.

When you don‚Äôt know which cases are close to settlement, which firms are slow to respond, or which docs are missing‚Äîevery lien becomes a liability.

The solution isn‚Äôt more effort.

It‚Äôs more visibility.

When you centralise med-legal workflows and automate attorney follow-ups, lien-based care becomes what it was always meant to be: high-margin, high-impact, and finally‚Äîpredictable.

Gain,unknown,2025-09-22,"In PI law, every case isn‚Äôt just a file‚Äîit‚Äôs a revenue opportunity with timing, risk, and documentation attached.

Yet too many firms still struggle to connect case outcomes to actual collections. 
Why? 

Because:
- Open liens live in spreadsheets or email threads
- Case progress isn‚Äôt linked to revenue forecasts
- Delays and bottlenecks quietly eat into cash flow

To move from guesswork ‚Üí predictability, firms need to track:
- Lien progresses through each stage
- Recovery timing versus expectations
- High-risk cases before they turn into write-offs

Predictable revenue starts by knowing which cases are likely to pay‚Äîand which need attention before cash slips away.

At Gain, we tie every case outcome to collections and recovery timelines, helping your firm act faster, prioritize effectively, and forecast revenue with confidence.

In my last post, I shared why the old way of budgeting doesn‚Äôt work anymore in professional services.
The same goes for long-range planning (LRP).

That‚Äôs why, for a limited time, I‚Äôm still offering my traditional Professional Services LRP for free (link in comments). It‚Äôs still highly relevant across many parts of the PS business model and can create real value.

But here‚Äôs the reality:
‚Ä¢ SG&A is heavier. Tech, BD, and enablement costs are rising.
‚Ä¢ Capex is higher. AI, automation, and platforms are now table stakes.
‚Ä¢ Efficiency > headcount. Growth depends on getting more from the team you already have.

These shifts mean LRPs need an overhaul, not just a tune-up. And I‚Äôll be releasing a new version soon ‚Äî one that‚Äôs built for today‚Äôs market realities. That one won‚Äôt be free.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-20,"One of the most underrated hiring signals?

‚ÄúDo they genuinely care?‚Äù

Not just about the title or the perks. But about the work. The mission. The outcomes. 

About doing things right, especially when it‚Äôs hard, unclear, or unglamorous.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen‚Äîover and over again:

1 People who care deeply will figure things out. 

2 People who care take ownership, even when no one‚Äôs watching. 

3 People who don‚Äôt? 

Eventually slow everything down‚Äîno matter how sharp their resume looks.

I‚Äôve worked in operationally intense environments‚Äîwhere timing is everything, follow-through is critical, and breakdowns have real downstream consequences.

In those environments, caring isn‚Äôt a bonus trait‚Äîit‚Äôs core infrastructure.

That‚Äôs why, when I hire, I don‚Äôt just look for experience. 

I listen for evidence of care:

What‚Äôs the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever worked on?

Why did it matter to you?

What kept you going when things got hard?

What are you most proud of?

Was it worth it?

The best people? They don‚Äôt just recall the result‚Äîthey remember the effort. 

The obsession. The commitment. 

Because for them, caring is the baseline‚Äînot the exception.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-19,"üí° Confession: I posted about budgeting in professional services earlier.
And as soon as I hit ""Post"", I realized I‚Äôd lost the plot.

I framed budgeting the way I‚Äôve done it successfully in the past ‚Äî lock revenue, back into hiring, manage gross margin.

That worked in the old paradigm: more people ‚Üí more hours ‚Üí more revenue.

But the ground has shifted.
We‚Äôre not in a headcount-driven world anymore.

üëâ Today‚Äôs budgeting paradigm is about efficiency, not just expansion:
‚Üí More revenue per FTE
‚Üí Comp increases + retention to protect your best people
‚Üí Cross-practice leverage to balance utilization
‚Üí L&D and higher-value services to push up realization and pricing
‚Üí AI, automation, and platforms to free capacity and scale smarter

In other words, the budget conversation is no longer just:
‚ÄúHow many people do we need?‚Äù

It‚Äôs: ‚ÄúHow do we get more from the team we have ‚Äî and what investments unlock that?‚Äù

Budgeting for 2026 isn‚Äôt a spreadsheet drill.
It‚Äôs a strategic design exercise for growth, talent, and technology in a new paradigm.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-18,"The best leadership lessons I‚Äôve learned didn‚Äôt come from one industry.

They came from moving across four very different ones.

Consumer goods at Coca-Cola.
Travel tech at Expedia.
Electric vehicles at Pure Watercraft.
SaaS & AI at Gain.

On paper, those businesses don‚Äôt look alike.
Different models. Different customers. Different challenges.
But working across them taught me things I never would‚Äôve learned if I had stayed in one lane.

Switching industries forces you to adapt fast.
Every sector speaks its own language‚Äî
SKU margins in consumer goods.
CAC and LTV in SaaS.
Manufacturing cycles in EVs.
The only way forward is to get comfortable being uncomfortable.

It also trains you to spot patterns others miss.
What worked in travel analytics later became the foundation for real-time forecasting in SaaS.
Innovation rarely comes from reinventing the wheel.
It comes from cross-pollination.

And it gives you perspective.
Coca-Cola taught me scale.
Expedia taught me agility.
Pure Watercraft taught me capital intensity.
Gain taught me recurring revenue dynamics.
Each lens sharpens the next.

The real benefit? Resilience.
Every industry goes through cycles.
Tech booms and busts.
Consumer demand shifts.
EVs ride hype waves and funding droughts.
When you‚Äôve lived through them all, you stop panicking at the first storm.

The best leaders aren‚Äôt defined by one playbook.
They connect lessons across industries to solve problems others can‚Äôt see coming.

Has working across industries made you a better leader?

+ If you are not sure, join my next masterclass: https://lnkd.in/einkvr_2

I will explain to you which AI tool you should choose for Finance

And also I will showcase my secrets on how to become an AI CFO!
1. Financial Analysis with AI
2. Scenario Modeling
3. AI Roadmap and more!


Which GenAI should you actually use
ChatGPT or Copilot?

That‚Äôs a question I get a lot

That‚Äôs why I created this guide for you.

Here‚Äôs my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You‚Äôre an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you‚Äôre a small business‚Äîit has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot‚Äôs most underrated feature‚Äîand the main reason to choose it if you‚Äôre a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That‚Äôs a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft‚Äôs security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it‚Äôs tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon

Bottom line
Choose based on where your work lives, not the hype
Tell me which one is your favorite ones and why!

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-17,"Accounting firms are scaling in wildly different ways right now.

‚Üí¬†Crete Professionals Alliance (Thrive-backed) plans to deploy $500M+ into acquisitions and AI upgrades, already surging past $300M revenue.
‚Üí¬†Prosperity Partners (Unity-backed) was #2 on Accounting Today‚Äôs 2025 Fastest-Growing Firms, expanding through multiple acquisitions.
‚Üí¬†Springline Advisory (Trinity Hunt) and Platform AG are rolling up boutiques into regional platforms.
‚Üí¬†Incumbents like Citrin Cooperman, Grant Thornton, and BDO are reshaping themselves with PE or private credit.

And now Aline Accounting Partners is testing something new: a $100M debt package with a $57.8M DDTL to fund add-ons. Starting from just $21M, they could add $40‚Äì60M and vault into the Top 100‚Äîwithout a disclosed PE sponsor.

It‚Äôs the same consolidation spectrum, but with a new twist: private credit as the driver instead of private equity.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-17,"Inside finance teams, budget season is joked as ‚Äúthe most wonderful time of the year.‚Äù (Spoiler: it‚Äôs not.)

When I was more junior, my wife and I took our 8-month-old to visit her grandparents in Romania. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, while the family feasted on Sarmale (Romanian stuffed cabbage ‚Äî IYKYK), I was hunched over my laptop obsessing over budget scenarios.

The process hadn‚Äôt been designed properly from the start ‚Äî and the cost was personal.

That‚Äôs what happens when #budgeting is treated as a spreadsheet drill instead of a strategic process:
‚Äì Infighting over departmental dollars
‚Äì Analysts building models with no strategy behind them
‚Äì Deadlines blown
‚Äì Teams grinding through the holidays when it should already be locked down

It was a real learning experience, and I never let that happen again.

If you‚Äôre an #accounting firm with a December fiscal year-end, your Annual Operating Plan (AOP) process should already be underway ‚Äî or kicking off right now.

Otherwise, you risk not only missed deadlines, but also missed time with family. And that‚Äôs time you don‚Äôt get back ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs stuffed cabbage or whatever special treat is on your family‚Äôs table.

After 10+ years leading these cycles for consulting and accounting firms, I‚Äôve seen two outcomes:
‚úÖ Strategic AOPs that align leadership and chart growth
‚ùå Budgets that devolve into expense allocations no one revisits

For #ManagingPartners, this isn‚Äôt about spreadsheets ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of the most important levers you have to set direction.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-16,"Most startups don‚Äôt fail because the idea was bad.
They fail because the finances were.

I‚Äôve seen it across industries
From SaaS to EVs to consumer goods.
The pattern repeats itself every time.

The first blind spot is cash flow mismanagement.
Revenue might be climbing.
The pipeline might be full.
But if cash is trapped in receivables or inventory, the business runs out of oxygen.
Profit on paper doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt make payroll.

The second blind spot is scaling too fast.
I‚Äôve watched companies add headcount, launch products, and pour money into marketing before proving the model.
It feels like momentum, until the burn rate outruns reality.
Growth without a financial foundation is just acceleration toward a cliff.

The third blind spot is poor forecasting.
Too many startups rely on spreadsheets built for today.
Static, fragile, already outdated by the time the quarter ends.
Without rolling forecasts and scenario planning, leadership reacts instead of anticipates.
And by the time they see the wall, it‚Äôs too late to swerve.

Here‚Äôs the truth¬†
Startups don‚Äôt need perfect forecasts.
They need realistic ones.
Ones that show exactly when cash will run out.
And what levers they can pull to extend runway.

Because surviving isn‚Äôt about brilliance.
It‚Äôs about clarity.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-15,"The Best Leadership Advice I‚Äôve Read This Month

Last week, my colleague Danika R., VP of Operations at Gain, published an article that really stayed with me: ‚ÄúIf I Had 15 Minutes With Every Person on My Team, Here‚Äôs What I‚Äôd Say.‚Äù

Her message was simple but profound:
‚Üí Be quick to listen, but not quick to respond.
‚Üí Use the tools, but don‚Äôt lose your judgment.
‚Üí And above all, remember there‚Äôs a real person on the other side of every file.

I‚Äôve had the privilege of working alongside Danika, and I‚Äôve seen her lead with exactly these principles. 

In a high-stakes, high-speed business, it‚Äôs easy to focus on efficiency alone. What Danika reminds us is that efficiency without empathy is fragile.

As finance leaders, we talk a lot about data, forecasting, and strategy. But the same truth applies in finance as in operations: it‚Äôs not just what gets done¬†it‚Äôs how we show up that defines us.

Danika‚Äôs perspective is a powerful reminder that culture, empathy, and human connection aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù¬†they‚Äôre competitive advantages.

I encourage you to read her article,¬†Link in comment",22,4,,26,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_the-best-leadership-advice-ive-read-this-activity-7373358637421076480-sswt,Default
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-15,"KPIs are in style. Every ‚Äústrategic finance‚Äù professional throws around the term. But let‚Äôs break down how strategic they actually are.

In professional services, the big KPIs are well known:
‚óè¬†Utilization rate
‚óè¬†Realization rate
‚óè¬†Revenue per consultant
‚óè¬†Gross margin by client

Useful? Absolutely. Actionable? Rarely. By the time utilization dips or realization falls, the damage is already done. These KPIs are lagging indicators.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been leaning into a different lens: aKPIs ‚Äî actionable KPIs.

üëâ aKPIs measure the levers you can pull today.
Examples of professional services aKPIs:
‚óè¬†Pipeline health aKPI: % of proposals delivered within 5 business days of client request.
‚óè¬†Engagement efficiency aKPI: # of proactive scope-change conversations initiated with clients.
‚óè¬†Talent leverage aKPI: Hours delivered by associates vs. partners on major accounts.
‚óè¬†Client success aKPI: % of deliverables reviewed internally 48+ hours before deadlines.

But here‚Äôs the nuance: simply calling something an aKPI isn‚Äôt enough.
For an aKPI to actually drive results, you need infrastructure:

1. Real-time tracking ‚Üí If an aKPI is only updated monthly, it‚Äôs no longer actionable. Weekly or daily visibility is a must.
2. Lever maps ‚Üí For each aKPI, you need a clear process map: ‚ÄúWhen this metric slips, here are the 2‚Äì3 levers to pull.‚Äù Otherwise, you‚Äôre monitoring without action.
3. Trigger systems ‚Üí Alerts and dashboards that surface drift in time to act ‚Äî not just in time to report.

That‚Äôs when an aKPI becomes more than a number. It becomes a control system.

I was inspired to sharpen this framing in a conversation with Soufyan Hamid, who‚Äôs been pushing the finance community to rethink how we measure and communicate performance.

üîπ Curious to hear: what‚Äôs one KPI you‚Äôve turned into an aKPI, and how have you built the systems to make it truly actionable?",19,11,1,31,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathansaperia_kpis-are-in-style-every-strategic-finance-activity-7373337122776457216-MYDo,Default

Defensiveness.

Friday night asks. Reporting feedback on the ‚Äúbest-in-class‚Äù deck. Advisors showing up without warning.

Finance teams bristle.

Why fix what‚Äôs working?

But the strongest teams learn to reframe it.

It‚Äôs not about what‚Äôs broken ‚Äî it‚Äôs about what‚Äôs possible.

Every month, you probably need to manually merge CSVs, categorize expenses, and reformat reports just to get through close.
Copy. Paste. Repeat

That was my case for some of my accounting process in my business.

So built a simple automation stack using AI ‚Äî and shaved hours off my month-end process.

Here‚Äôs how you can do the same

‚úÖ Traditional Automation ‚Äì Python + Google Sheets

‚úÖ AI Workflows ‚Äì Custom GPTs for document processing

‚úÖ AI Agents ‚Äì Trigger-based actions to handle tasks automatically

----

Here are 3 practical ways finance teams can use AI to save time, reduce errors, and focus on higher-value work:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Automating the Close with AI

- Use Python scripts or Google Apps Script to clean, merge, and format data
- Automate file cleanup in Google Sheets or Excel
- No more manually removing empty rows or formatting columns


2Ô∏è‚É£ AI for Expense Categorization

One of the biggest time-wasters? Manually categorizing expenses.
You can automate this using a Custom GPT:

Steps include:
- Create your GPT
- Upload a CSV
- Let GPT classify expenses by category
- Download a clean, categorized report for upload

One finance pro from the AI Finance Club eliminated 90% of manual expense categorization using this!

3Ô∏è‚É£ Categorization Agent

üì• With tools like n8n, you can:

- Detect incoming CSV files
- Clean data with formatting rules
- Use AI to categorize each transaction
- Output everything neatly into a single file

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-12,"Want to be a CFO? Do it for the right reasons.

I used to think becoming a CFO meant I‚Äôd finally made it.

The title. The boardroom. The strategy. The upside.

But here‚Äôs the part that doesn‚Äôt show up in the headlines:
‚Üí It‚Äôs lonely.
‚Üí You‚Äôre constantly on the hook.
‚Üí If anything breaks, your name‚Äôs the first on the list.
‚Üí And yes‚Äîat every level up the finance ladder, I‚Äôve worked more, not less.

In private equity-backed companies, CFO turnover is sky-high.
Why?
A mix of burnout + zero tolerance for underperformance.
The expectations are brutal‚Äîand not always realistic.

To the up-and-comers in finance:

I know it‚Äôs tempting to chase the title.
But make sure you know what you‚Äôre really signing up for.
It‚Äôs not prestige. It‚Äôs pressure.
It‚Äôs not just numbers. It‚Äôs narrative, politics, and accountability.

üëâ To the CFOs out there:
I respect you more than you can imagine.
You carry a weight most people never see.
You hold the line when no one else can.

If you want to become a CFO, do it.
But do it for the right reasons:
‚Üí Because you love owning the outcome
‚Üí Because you can lead through chaos
‚Üí Because you‚Äôre willing to be the one who stays calm when everyone else panics

Just don‚Äôt do it for the LinkedIn headline.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-08,"Private equity isn‚Äôt just buying Accounting Firms.
They‚Äôve been investing in OCFO Advisory firms for over a decade ‚Äî
but only recently have they started buying both sides of the finance stack.

EDIT: full article now available! https://lnkd.in/gF6TxAUN

One of the earliest to spot this opportunity? New Mountain Capital.
They acquired Citrin Cooperman, scaled it, and in a landmark move‚Ä¶
sold it to Blackstone ‚Äî the first-ever PE-to-PE ‚Äúturn‚Äù in accounting history.

That ""turn"" marked a turning point.

Within months, New Mountain went on a spree:
‚Üí Wipfli
‚Üí Grant Thornton
‚Üí Portage Point Partners ‚Äî a pure-play advisory firm with a strong OCFO practice
All brought into the NMC portfolio.

And they‚Äôre not alone. Today, several funds are building dual-platform strategies:
‚û°Ô∏è Charlesbank: Accordion (OCFO) + Aprio (Accounting)
‚û°Ô∏è Parthenon Capital: Embark (OCFO) + Cherry Bekaert (Accounting)
‚û°Ô∏è Unity Partners: Amplƒìo (OCFO) + Prosperity Partners (Accounting)

Some started with advisory and added accounting. Others did the reverse.
But either way, this isn‚Äôt just roll-up economics.
It‚Äôs convergence.

Here‚Äôs the nuance most don‚Äôt see yet:
‚Üí These firms are still being run independently.
‚Üí Same fund, different playbooks.
‚Üí Maybe a little knowledge-sharing‚Ä¶ but no real collaboration.

So the question becomes:
üîÑ Will we start to see cross-portfolio collaboration?
ü§ù Will any of these pairs eventually merge into a unified platform?
üìà Will a full-stack ‚ÄúFinance Platform‚Äù emerge ‚Äî spanning audit, tax, CFO services, and FP&A?

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-08,"If your finance team spends more time formatting decks than influencing strategy, you hired wrong

I‚Äôve seen this play out too many times.

The finance team works late nights building perfect slides.
Charts are aligned. Fonts are consistent. Every number ties back.

And yet, when the deck hits the table‚Ä¶ nothing changes.
Because pretty slides don‚Äôt drive strategy.

Here‚Äôs the truth:

A finance team that‚Äôs focused on presentation instead of perspective is a wasted investment.

Great decks might impress for a moment. Great insights shape decisions for months.

The difference comes down to what you hire for:

‚Üí Do they ask why the numbers look the way they do?
Or do they just copy-paste into slides without questioning the assumptions?

‚Üí Do they connect the data to real business trade-offs?
Or do they just report history without showing what it means for tomorrow?

‚Üí Do they simplify complexity for leadership?
Or do they hide behind jargon and endless tables that no one will use?

Formatting can be outsourced.
Insight cannot.

If your finance team isn‚Äôt influencing where to spend, when to hire, or how to manage cash, then you don‚Äôt have finance you have reporting.

The best finance teams don‚Äôt just track the business.
They change how it runs.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-05,"Regulation Needs Precision ‚Äî Not Panic.

The growing crackdown on third-party litigation funding is understandable. 

But not all funding is created equal.

At Gain, we sit at the intersection of patient care and case outcomes‚Äîsupporting providers who treat on lien so injured people can get care before a settlement comes through.

The challenge?

Regulators are conflating med-legal servicing with speculative litigation funding models. 

 Its dangerous, as it risks cutting off access to care and bankrupting providers for following the rules.

We‚Äôre not betting on legal outcomes. 

We‚Äôre supporting care that‚Äôs already been delivered‚Äîand tying revenue to case progress in a transparent, accountable way.

If lawmakers want to regulate this space, they should. 

But they need to regulate the right thing.

We‚Äôre open to oversight. 

We‚Äôre not okay with being mislabeled.

Most CFOs I meet fall into two camps:

Traditional CFOs rely on judgment and experience
AI CFOs add speed, insight, and scale

Which one are you today?

Traditional CFOs are diligent. Every month, he:
1. Spends 2 days making board decks
2. Writes 6 hours of financial commentary
3. Consolidates Excel files for 3‚Äì4 hours
4. Feels stressed in audits due to poor docs

AI CFOs does this to save time each month:
1. Automates files with ChatGPT + Python
2. Creates tailored commentaries in 10 minutes
3. Builds models with simple prompts
4. Drafts SOPs, letters, and checklists instantly

Both are smart. Both are experienced
But one spends his time buried in spreadsheets
The other spends his time leading

That‚Äôs the shift from Traditional CFO ‚ûù AI-Driven CFO

Why it matters:

Traditional CFOs rely on credibility, judgment, and personal leadership. But they also suffer from:
1. Manual, slower processes
2. Limited visibility for real-time forecasting
3. Higher error risks with complex data
4. Struggles to scale insights across fast-changing markets

AI-Driven CFOs keep the leadership strengths and add speed, automation, and insight. They:
1. Run ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios in real time
2. Detect anomalies 24/7
3. Free up time from routine tasks to lead & coach
4. Scale faster without losing oversight

How to be an AI CFO:
Begin by applying AI to the finance tasks that drain the most time

1. Generate financial commentary ‚Üí 6-hour process cut to 10 minutes
2. Run scenario modeling ‚Üí instant best/worst-case outcomes
3. Merge financial files ‚Üí save hours in reporting cycles

The reality is clear: AI is no longer optional for CFOs who want to lead at scale

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-04,"Rainmakers get the credit.
But internal referrals build the firm.

Most people think of business development at professional-services firms as:
üçæ Champagne with PE deal partners
‚õ≥ Golf with managing directors

It feels glorious to some, daunting to others.
Like you need a massive Rolodex‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and maybe a diamond-encrusted Rolex too. üíé

But some of the best firms don‚Äôt rely on rainmakers.
They rely on something quieter‚Äî
üëâ Internal cross-sell.

I‚Äôve always believed internal referrals are one of the most powerful levers a firm can build.
And recent conversations have reinforced just how intentionally the best firms are operationalizing it.

But it‚Äôs not a flip-a-switch tactic.
It‚Äôs a multi-layered process:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Recognize how valuable internal cross-sell actually is
2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the muscles‚Äîtrain teams to spot and share real opportunities

That last one? Brutal.
Traditional BD is hard enough to measure.
Internal BD adds a whole new layer‚Äî
You‚Äôre tracking trust. Conversations. Follow-through.

But the firms that crack it?
They build a quiet engine.
One that compounds over time.

It creates a flywheel:
‚Üí¬†Deliver exceptional work in one area
‚Üí¬†Build trust across the account
‚Üí¬†Let referrals pull in new services‚Äîwithout ever ‚Äúselling‚Äù

If you think BD is only for extroverts and rainmakers‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre missing where the real leverage lives.
Internal cross-sell is the unsexy system behind sustainable growth.
And it separates firms that hustle‚Ä¶
from firms that scale.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-09-03,"EBITDA Explained

10 Free finance resources: https://lnkd.in/gDvEERe5

What is EBITDA, and what is your take on this metric?

‚Üí EBITDA stands for:
‚Ä¢ Earnings
‚Ä¢ Before
‚Ä¢ Interest
‚Ä¢ Taxes
‚Ä¢ Depreciation
‚Ä¢ Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account non-operational expenses like interest and taxes and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization

‚Üí Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It‚Äôs like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


‚Üí How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

Another way to calculate it:

Net Income
+ Interest Expense
+ Taxes
+ Depreciation
+ Amortization

‚Üí EBITDA vs. Net Income

EBITDA:
In EBITDA, you don‚Äôt take into consideration these expenses: Depreciation, Taxes, Interest.

Net Income:
But the net income is what remains as actual profit after depreciation, interest, taxes are taken in account.

Gain,unknown,2025-09-03,"Are your personal injury collections slower than you‚Äôd like?

If you're still managing cases manually‚Äîusing spreadsheets, emails, and waiting for attorneys to follow through‚Äîyou might be missing out on hundreds of thousands in lost collections.

Here are 3 major pain points many healthcare providers face:

1. Manual Tracking - Missed updates, delays, and errors are inevitable.
2. Poor Attorney Communication - Disputes over reduced payments or missing documentation.
3. No Clear Payment Predictions - Guesswork when it comes to knowing when settlements will happen.

The good news?

You don't need to hire more staff to solve this. The future of PI collections lies in AI-driven automation that helps streamline the entire case process‚Äîfrom intake to payment.

It‚Äôs time to stop letting manual processes drain your resources.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-02,"4 budgeting frameworks to try if you hate budgeting

Most leaders hate budgeting.¬†
And honestly, I don‚Äôt blame them.

Traditional budgets are slow.
They‚Äôre outdated the moment they‚Äôre done.
And they often feel more like a political process than a planning tool.

But here‚Äôs the truth¬†
The problem isn‚Äôt budgeting itself.
It‚Äôs the framework you‚Äôre using.

Here are 4 approaches that actually work, depending on where your business is 

1. Zero-based budgeting
Start from zero every year.
Force every expense to be justified, not just carried forward.
Great for lean teams or companies that need to cut fat without killing growth.

2. Top-down + bottom-up blend
Leadership sets targets. Teams build from the ground up.
The budget becomes a negotiation between ambition and reality.
Perfect for high-growth companies that want alignment across departments.

3. Rolling reforecast (R12)
Forget the annual budget. Update every month or quarter on a rolling 12-month basis.
This keeps the focus on agility, not predicting the unpredictable.
Best for dynamic industries where conditions change fast.

Strategic initiative-based budgeting
Instead of line items, budget around priorities: new product, market expansion, sales motion.
It forces alignment of dollars to strategy, not just costs to departments.

Budgeting doesn‚Äôt have to be painful.
But it does have to be intentional.

The right framework gives you clarity, flexibility, and control.
The wrong one gives you noise.

Which framework does your team use and does it actually work?",34,20,,54,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_4-budgeting-frameworks-to-try-if-you-hate-activity-7368646230484107267-Rrmk,Default

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-02,"Being right isn‚Äôt enough. You have to be heard. And being heard isn‚Äôt enough. 

You have to influence action.

That‚Äôs the real challenge in any complex system‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a healthcare network, a law firm, or a tech company.

We‚Äôve all been there:

-A solid solution

-A smarter process

-A fix everyone should want...

And still, no buy-in. No momentum. No change.

What I‚Äôve learned over the years is that influence isn‚Äôt about control‚Äîit‚Äôs about clarity, connection, and timing.

It starts with: 

‚Üí Understanding what success looks like for you 

‚Üí Then mapping what it looks like for them 

‚Üí And finally, aligning those visions so people want to move forward with you‚Äînot because they‚Äôre told to, but because they‚Äôre convinced it‚Äôs the right path.

At Gain, we don‚Äôt just build systems for better revenue outcomes. 

We help leaders build influence internally‚Äîso better ideas actually get implemented.

Why does it matter?
Because it fixes 3 major pain points

1. Consistency ‚Äì no more ‚ÄúAI face‚Äù problems or mismatched styles

2. Multi-step natural edits ‚Äì edit background, replace text, adjust visuals, all in one flow

3. Blending & fusion ‚Äì images look natural, not stitched together, and take note, this is only the preview model!

This is a leap forward for:

1. Finance visuals (reports, dashboards, IPO decks)

2. Executive headshots & media content

3. Brand consistency (style-coherent graphics)

4. M&A deal storyboards

In this infographic I break it down:

1. What Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is & where to access

2. Why it‚Äôs such a breakthrough for enterprise visuals

3. Model comparison vs. ChatGPT 4o

4. Strengths, weaknesses, and when to use it

5. Real finance use cases

6. Most importantly, a remedy fix for low-quality

Finance leaders, think investor decks that actually look professional storyboards for deals, and clear visualizations for KPIs

Oh, and the key thing I want you to remember:

Strengths

1. Great at ‚Äúdon‚Äôt change X, only change Y‚Äù

2. Precise edits and continuity

3. It obeys instructions literally, so prompts need to be direct

Weaknesses

1. Struggles with highly creative prompts (‚Äúmake this anime-style‚Äù often falls flat)

2. Needs careful data input‚Äîtypos or sloppy metrics can propagate

3. Output is low-res, but this seems limited to the Preview model

ChatGPT 4o Image gen

Strengths

1. Strong when asked to invent visuals from scratch

2. Iterative chat flow is its superpower‚Äîdescribe, refine, reframe

3. Responds best to descriptive, stylized storytelling prompts

Weaknesses

1. Terrible at ‚Äúdon‚Äôt change X, only change Y‚Äù scenarios

2. Struggles with reference-image editing

3. Data-heavy prompts sometimes lose fidelity (numbers can change)

Most finance teams think the value of a model lives in the numbers.
How precise it is.
How many tabs it has.
How airtight the formulas are.

But the truth is¬†
A model is useless if it doesn‚Äôt change how leaders think and act.

I‚Äôve seen models built to perfection‚Äî60 tabs, immaculate logic, variance reconciled to the decimal.
And yet, no decisions changed.
No trade-offs clarified.
No strategy sharpened.

Conversations do.

Here‚Äôs what the best models actually do:

‚Üí They spark hard hiring conversations.
‚ÄúDo we add 10 people this quarter, or do we delay until revenue catches up?‚Äù

‚Üí They challenge strategy.
‚ÄúIf we expand into this market, do margins hold or collapse under scale?‚Äù

‚Üí They expose trade-offs.
‚ÄúDo we double down on product now, or extend runway to survive another 18 months?‚Äù

‚Üí They force discipline.
‚ÄúWhat happens if funding takes 6 months longer than expected?‚Äù

A financial model isn‚Äôt supposed to predict the future.
It‚Äôs supposed to create clarity in the present.
Clarity that drives alignment in the boardroom.
Clarity that forces executives to face uncomfortable truths.
Clarity that moves decisions forward instead of recycling the same debates every quarter.

If your financial model isn‚Äôt sparking debate, testing assumptions, and changing how leaders allocate capital‚Ä¶
Then you don‚Äôt have a financial model.
You have a spreadsheet.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-28,"Advisory has more than one front door.

For some, it‚Äôs diligence.
For others, it‚Äôs valuation.

üß© Crete Professionals Alliance  + Cabrillo shows how that plays out.

Cabrillo brings:
‚Ä¢ Business, security & IP valuations
‚Ä¢ Fairness opinions for M&A and financing
‚Ä¢ Equity comp, estate & gift planning
‚Ä¢ Complex GAAP, tax, and reporting support

This isn‚Äôt compliance.
It‚Äôs high-trust, high-context advisory.

‚∏ª

Why it matters:

‚û°Ô∏è For Crete‚Äôs member firms:
Valuation becomes part of their client offering ‚Äî overnight.

‚û°Ô∏è For Cabrillo:
National reach.
Cross-sell opportunities.
Shared services: HR, IT, legal, AI tooling.
Offshore delivery teams.
Growth infrastructure.
No brand dilution.

‚∏ª

Crete didn‚Äôt buy Cabrillo ‚Äî they took an equity stake.
A partnership, not a takeover.
Strategic alignment, not assimilation.

‚∏ª

This isn‚Äôt a roll-up.
It‚Äôs a platform.
Built from scratch.

Modern tech.
Centralized ops.
$500M to deploy.
20+ firms already on board.
California as a key growth frontier.

‚∏ª

Valuation here is advisory.
And also a wedge.

Because when you help a client navigate valuation‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre often still in the room for what comes next:

‚Üí Comp
‚Üí Tax
‚Üí Audit
‚Üí Strategy

That‚Äôs not just expansion.
That‚Äôs positioning.

‚∏ª

Advisory is the entry point.
Infrastructure is the multiplier.
Crete is designing both.

Why this works:

- We avoid ‚Äúshadow IT‚Äù by selecting one approved AI inside their existing security perimeter (mostly Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace).

- Then we run a 30-day enablement: adapted use cases, hands-on prompts, custom finance agents, and I help them build an environment for sharing wins.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-25,"The 5 hardest truths no one tells you before becoming a CFO

Everyone talks about the prestige of the CFO seat.
The board meetings. The influence. The strategy.

But no one prepares you for the realities that come with it.

Here are 5 truths I wish someone had told me earlier 

1. The numbers are the easy part
Models, reports, forecasts, those are table stakes.
What really tests you is driving alignment when the numbers say something no one wants to hear.

2. You won‚Äôt always be liked
Good CFOs make tough calls.
Great CFOs make them earlier than anyone else wants to.
Clarity doesn‚Äôt always make you popular but it keeps the company alive.

3. Your job resets every 6 months
At $5M ARR, you‚Äôre cleaning up the books.
At $20M, you‚Äôre building systems.
At $50M, you‚Äôre shaping strategy.
If you don‚Äôt evolve with the role, you‚Äôll get left behind.

4. You spend more time on people than numbers
Coaching controllers. Translating finance for operators.
Building trust with the CEO and board.
The spreadsheet is the tool but people are the job.

5. Speed beats polish
You‚Äôll never have perfect data.
You‚Äôll never have the full picture.
You have to make the call anyway and own it.

No one tells you these truths when you‚Äôre climbing.
But they‚Äôre the difference between CFOs who survive and CFOs who scale.

If you‚Äôre aiming for the seat, don‚Äôt just prepare to manage numbers.
Prepare to manage reality.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-25,"Accounting firms are looking in the wrong place to build their OCFO Strategic Finance advisory practices.

Most accounting firms think their OCFO advisory bench is the closest thing to Strategic Finance.

It‚Äôs not.

üëâ The real on-ramp is Financial Due Diligence (FDD).

Why?
‚Ä¢ EBITDA normalization = Strat Fin‚Äôs cash flow bridge
‚Ä¢ Deal cadence = the same transaction rhythm as portcos
‚Ä¢ Sponsor exposure = daily conversations with PE and lenders

At my prior firm, we mostly staffed Strat Fin from IB and FP&A.
But when we brought in FDD talent?
Many were just as strong in Excel modeling ‚Äî sometimes stronger.

True Strat Fin firms know this.
They staff from adjacencies like IB, FP&A, T&R.

Accounting firms often miss it.

‚úÖ Don‚Äôt just default to OCFO advisory.
‚úÖ Reverse engineer.
‚úÖ Use TAS as your bridge to build an OCFO Strategic Finance advisory practice.

The firms that win won‚Äôt stop at QofE ‚Äî they‚Äôll turn FDD into Strategic Finance.

1. EBITDA

What is EBITDA?

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization

Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

‚Ä¢ EBITDA gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

‚Ä¢ This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.

2. CAPEX

What is CAPEX?

Capex, short for ‚ÄúCÔªøapital Expenditure‚Äù

It is a long-term investment made by a business in assets like equipment, property, and buildings.

These investments provide benefits to the company for years to come, and can help businesses grow and improve their operations.

Why is CAPEX essential for businesses?

‚Ä¢ It helps businesses grow and improve their operations.

‚Ä¢ It can help increase productivity and efficiency.

‚Ä¢ It can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

3. Cash

What is Cash Flow?

It is like the money that comes in and out of your piggy bank.

Why is Cash Flow important for businesses?

It is important for Businesses & Adults because they need to make sure they have enough money to:

‚Ä¢ Pay for things like rent, salaries, and supplies.

‚Ä¢ Invest in growing business or saving for the future.

4. Tax

What is Tax?

Think of tax like a membership fee you pay to be part of a club, but this club is your country or city.

This money is used to keep parks clean, schools running, and streets safe.

Why is it important?

In real life, taxes pay for things like libraries, firefighters, and playgrounds.

When you enjoy a clean beach or a safe road, it's partly thanks to taxes.

Gain,unknown,2025-08-22,"In PI law, a lien isn‚Äôt just a balance‚Äîit‚Äôs a living financial asset tied to legal risk, time, and documentation.
But too many firms still rely on traditional AR reports that miss the mark. Why? Because:
Aging buckets ‚â† Real-time risk
You need to track:
Conversion probability
Recovery velocity
Documentation completeness
Smart firms are moving from reconciliation ‚Üí optimization.
This shift requires:
1 Real-time lien visibility
2  Risk scoring by attorney, case, and jurisdiction
3 Coordination across legal, finance & collections
Forecasting liquidity starts by knowing which liens are maturing‚Äîand which are quietly going stale.
At Gain, we treat liens like what they are: financial assets with legal dependencies. Our platform helps you score, track, and recover smarter‚Äîso every dollar tied up in a lien moves closer to cash.
Let‚Äôs turn PI receivables into a revenue strategy, not just a report.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-22,"Another shot fired in accounting‚Äôs shift from audit to advisory.

Accounting firms don‚Äôt really want to sell audits anymore.
They want to sell advisory ‚Äî because that‚Äôs where the rate card (and the margins) live.

Grant Thornton (US)‚Äôs acquisition of Stax is a case study in how the best firms are playing out this game of chess.

Stax plugs into the PE lifecycle at exactly the right moments:

‚Ä¢ Commercial due diligence & exit readiness
‚Üí natural bridge to financial due diligence

‚Ä¢ Diligence mandates
‚Üí often the trigger for 100-day planning and value creation

‚Ä¢ Once the firm knows the ins and outs
‚Üí far less friction to layer in recurring attest and more

If you‚Äôve sold CDD into a sponsor, you‚Äôve seen it:
One mandate turns into five.
Advisory turns into infrastructure.
Suddenly, the ‚Äúaccounting firm‚Äù is everywhere.

This isn‚Äôt just about margin lift.

It‚Äôs about owning the relationship ‚Äî from diligence to exit ‚Äî
and monetizing every stage along the way.

Advisory is the new front door.
Attest is the sticky back end.
And firms like GT are quietly building the whole house.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-21,"Most companies don‚Äôt fail because of bad products.
They fail because of bad finance decisions.

Here are 7 finance mistakes that cost companies millions

1. Hiring too early.
You don‚Äôt need a full-time CFO when a part-time controller would do.

2. Scaling before systems.
Headcount without clean workflows = chaos at scale.

3. Confusing revenue with cash flow.
Revenue looks good in a pitch deck. Cash pays payroll.

4. Forecasting on hope, not data.
Optimism makes pretty models. Reality breaks them fast.

5. Ignoring unit economics.
Top-line growth hides weak margins. Bad economics always win in the end.

6. Treating FP&A like reporting.
Closing the books isn‚Äôt enough. FP&A exists to drive better decisions.

7. Waiting too long to cut costs.
Hope is not a strategy. Delay turns small cuts into existential crises.

The smartest companies don‚Äôt avoid every mistake.
They spot them early before they turn fatal.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-21,"I used to think speed in PI funding came down to paperwork.
Get the docs. Get the signatures. Get the approval.
But I was wrong.
Because what really slows things down isn‚Äôt process.
It‚Äôs opacity.
Too many stakeholders.
Too many emails with no clear owner.
Cases stalled. Providers left waiting.
Patients stuck in limbo while funding sat in someone‚Äôs inbox.
That‚Äôs when I realised:
PI funding didn‚Äôt need more tech.
It needed more truth.
So we stripped it all down and rebuilt it‚Äîat Gain.
‚Üí No middlemen. Just a direct line from provider and attorney to funder.
‚Üí No markup games. Just transparent economics everyone understands.
‚Üí No black boxes. Just real-time visibility into where a case stands.
This isn‚Äôt just about speeding up approvals (though we often do it in 48 hours).
It‚Äôs about operational clarity in a space that‚Äôs built on chaos.
Because when funding flows, care gets delivered.
When attorneys aren‚Äôt chasing signatures, cases move.
When providers trust the system, they show up ready.
That‚Äôs the difference a clean infrastructure makes.
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building at Gain.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-08-20,"ChatGPT vs Copilot vs Gemini

+ Free Top 100 ChatGPT tips: https://lnkd.in/gdmuBSVX

Which GenAI should you actually use‚ÄîChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That‚Äôs a question I get a lot.

That‚Äôs why I created this guide for you.

Here‚Äôs my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You‚Äôre an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you‚Äôre a small business‚Äîit has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot‚Äôs most underrated feature‚Äîand the main reason to choose it if you‚Äôre a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
 Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
 Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
 Step 3. Enter the file name
 Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
 Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That‚Äôs a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft‚Äôs security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it‚Äôs tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails‚Äîit works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it‚Äôs basic‚Äîtoo much at stake with the world‚Äôs number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you‚Äôll never use email the old way!

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-19,"When not to automate in finance

Everyone talks about automation like it‚Äôs always the answer.
In finance, it isn‚Äôt.

Yes ‚Äî automation can save hours, reduce errors, and keep processes clean.
But sometimes, it hides the very signals you need to see.

Some processes are better left with human eyes and judgment.
Here‚Äôs where I don‚Äôt automate 

‚Üí Complex approvals
Large vendor contracts.
Strategic hires.
Capex that changes the company‚Äôs direction.
These aren‚Äôt ‚Äúclick approve‚Äù moments.
They need discussion, context, and often healthy disagreement.

‚Üí Exception handling
Automation handles the 95% that runs smoothly.
But it‚Äôs the 5% of anomalies, an unexpected invoice, a duplicate payment, a pricing mismatch, where the biggest mistakes (or fraud) live.
Humans catch nuance that rules can‚Äôt.

‚Üí Early-stage forecasting
When assumptions are shifting every week, you need to feel the numbers.
You need to run them, question them, break them, and rebuild them.
If you automate too early, you lose the instinct that comes from working closely with the data.

‚Üí Board and investor reporting
A dashboard can show you the metrics.
But it can‚Äôt tell you the story.
The story is what changes decisions.
And stories are told by people, not spreadsheets.

‚Üí Cash management in tight times
When runway is under pressure, no payment should leave without intention.
Automation makes outflows too easy.
Manual review keeps you close to every dollar leaving the bank.

If you had to pick one finance process to keep manual forever, what would it be?",50,24,,74,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_when-not-to-automate-in-finance-everyone-activity-7363572386517917698-1e0i,Default
My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-18,"The hidden costs of chasing ‚Äúperfect‚Äù forecasts

Every finance team wants a better forecast.
Few stop to ask: ‚ÄúAt what cost?‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen teams spend weeks trying to perfect the model.
Every assumption debated.
Every formula triple-checked.
Every decimal ‚Äújust right.‚Äù

And while the spreadsheet gets prettier‚Ä¶
The business stands still.

Here‚Äôs what chasing perfect does 

‚Üí It delays decisions
Opportunities expire while you‚Äôre polishing the model.
Speed beats precision in high-growth environments.

‚Üí It Creates False Confidence
A model can look airtight but still be built on guesses.
Perfect math on bad assumptions is still wrong.

‚Üí It burns resources
Hours from analysts.
Meetings with execs.
All spent to close the last 2% accuracy gap, which reality will blow up next quarter anyway.

‚Üí It kills adaptability
Perfect models are often too rigid.
The moment something changes, you‚Äôre rebuilding instead of adjusting.

Here‚Äôs the truth¬†
A forecast is a decision tool, not a work of art.
Its value is in how quickly it helps you see the trade-offs and act.

Good enough, fast, and adaptable will always beat perfect, late, and fragile.

The goal isn‚Äôt to predict the future exactly.
It‚Äôs to be ready for whatever future shows up.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-18,"If your team is still chasing attorneys manually, you‚Äôre not just losing time. You‚Äôre leaking revenue.

The way most clinics handle PI collections hasn‚Äôt changed in years:

- Spreadsheets

- Missed updates

- Slow attorney follow-ups

- No clarity on payment timelines

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äî You don‚Äôt need more staff. 

You need a smarter system.

The most efficient clinics I work with aren‚Äôt just working harder. They‚Äôre working predictively.

That means:

- Tracking every lien from intake to settlement

- Getting real-time alerts the moment a case progresses

- Knowing which attorneys delay, reduce, or pay in full

- Forecasting expected collections with confidence

- Automating payment requests so money doesn‚Äôt sit idle

Most clinics don‚Äôt fail to collect because they‚Äôre careless. They fail because they‚Äôre stuck managing PI the old way‚Äîmanually.

If you‚Äôve ever said: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even know the case settled,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why we weren‚Äôt paid in full‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably not your team. It‚Äôs your system.

If you want to plug the revenue leaks without burning out your staff, it‚Äôs time to upgrade the tools‚Äînot the headcount.

Gain,unknown,2025-08-18,"Traditional AR tools weren‚Äôt built for PI.

They don‚Äôt tell you which claims are quietly going stale‚Äîor which are ready to convert.

That‚Äôs where Lien Scoring changes everything.

What Should Your AR Stack Be Tracking?

It‚Äôs more than just balances‚Äîit‚Äôs about signals that drive recovery:

1. Documentation Status
 
    Missing LOPs or billing packets = denial risk
 
2. Legal Progress
 
    Filed vs. pre-lit vs. trial drastically shifts velocity
 
3. Claim Metadata
 
    Case type and jurisdiction = huge predictability factor
 

With scoring, each lien is benchmarked like a real financial asset.

You gain clarity on:

- Which liens are at risk?

- Which will likely convert?

- When to act and where to prioritize?

I have reviewed 1000s of CVs

In this post I share my tips and a Free CV Template (normally $27)

How to get the template?
Like this post, leave a comment or reshare this post.
(Everyday you get free value from me, liking or commenting is my only ask üôè)

Then go here to download the free CV: https://lnkd.in/e-RE-KKi

(Free but normally should be $27)

Here are my top 10 tips:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Title:

Start your CV with a title that aligns with the job you're targeting.

This immediately tells the hiring manager that you are a relevant candidate.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Highlight Relevant Skills:

Ensure that your CV prominently displays the skills relevant to the job.

For an FP&A role, your budgeting, forecasting, and variance analysis skills should be in the spotlight... but don't list it as skill without explanation, rather, say how you demonstrated these skills.

For example: ""streamlined the budget process by reducing the number of iterations from 5 versions to 3 versions"" or ""performed an analysis on profitability which highlighted the need to increase the price of product X by 5% to maximize the profitability""


3Ô∏è‚É£ Quantify Achievements:

Show your impact through numbers.

Rather than saying ""reduced month end close time,"" say ""reduced month end close by 2 days"" .


4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Action Verbs:

Begin bullet points with action verbs like ""managed,"" ""developed,"" or ""implemented.""

This shows you're proactive and saves space.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Tailor Your CV:

No two jobs are the same, and neither should be your CVs.

Tailor your CV to match the job description and requirements.


6Ô∏è‚É£ Keep It Concise:

In most cases, your CV should be no longer than two pages.

Prioritize information that adds value to your application.


7Ô∏è‚É£ Proofread:

Small errors can suggest a lack of attention to detail.

Proofread thoroughly and have someone else review it too.

I have read so many CVs with obvious mistakes which disqualified the applicant.

Remember Finance is a job where attention for details is important ;)


8Ô∏è‚É£ Formatting Matters:

Keep your formatting minimalistic and consistent.

Proof check tabulation, bullet point styles, break lines, font sizes etc.


9Ô∏è‚É£ Software Skills:

Be specific with your software skills.

Instead of mentioning ""Advanced Excel skills"", highlight your abilities to perform Financial Modeling, create Pivot Tables, or use Advanced Formulas.


üîü Focus on Recent Experiences:

Spend more space detailing your last two roles and be more succinct with earlier ones.

Recency often matters most to hiring managers.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-08-14,"CFO Mistake number 1: not using AI

Read further to discover the roadmap I have give to over 1,000 CFOs:
(the roadmap below is based on many minutes of transcripts worth thousands of dollars of consultation)

1) Foundation First ‚Äî ‚ÄúCrawl‚Äù
Why: Before anything clever, make AI safe, accessible, and pointed at work data.

How:
- Pick the stack your company already trusts (Microsoft ‚Üí Copilot 365; Google ‚Üí Gemini)
- Issue professional licenses (not just to managers) and turn on meeting transcripts
- If you‚Äôre not on Microsoft, ChatGPT Teams gives SOC2-type protections and connectors (Dropbox/Outlook/etc.).


2) Quick Wins that Stick ‚Äî ‚ÄúWalk‚Äù
Why: Early, visible wins build trust and momentum.

How: Start with 2‚Äì3 wins any team can repeat:
Auto-summarize meetings and extract actions from transcripts
Draft monthly review from call notes
 

3) Teach the Team, Not the Tool ‚Äî ‚ÄúOrganize‚Äù
Why: Licenses don‚Äôt equal adoption; cadence does

How:
- Launch a Teams/Slack channel for daily use-cases + Q&A
- Run bi-weekly ‚Äúlunch & learn‚Äù show-and-tells.
- After 6‚Äì8 weeks, hold a 2-hour hackathon focused on building agents/GPTs for real finance tasks
 

4) Projects vs. GPTs ‚Äî ‚ÄúSystematize‚Äù
Why: Consistency beats clever prompts.

How:
- Use Projects to hold client/company-specific files & context.
- Use Custom GPTs/Agents for repeatable tasks across clients (cash/flux analysis, email templates). Then call the GPT inside each project for consistent behavior. 


5) Data Foundations, Light ‚Äî ‚ÄúUn-silo‚Äù
Why: Most pain is messy, disconnected data; you don‚Äôt need a new ERP to start.

How:
- Stand up a light harmonization layer: use Zapier (fast) or N8N (flexible/self-hosted) to sync keys and push clean events between CRM, support, and accounting.
- Apply fuzzy matching on org names/addresses; standardize a master table. 

 
6) Automate the Repetitive ‚Äî ‚ÄúRun‚Äù
Why: Free up 20‚Äì40% of team time with safe, deterministic workflows

How:
- Use Power Automate/Office Scripts (Microsoft) to script repeatable flows: save attachments to SharePoint, transform Excel ‚Üí PowerPoint, label emails, schedule reports.
- Let AI write the scripts; humans review once. 


7) Build Finance Agents ‚Äî ‚ÄúAugment‚Äù
Why: Agents replace the human triggering AI by an automatic triggering: ‚Äúdo the thing when X happens.‚Äù

How:
- Start with agents for commentary drafting, classification, vendor form filling, or monthly flux notes
- Share agents internally so anyone can reuse and adapt 
- Tools: n8n, Copilot Studio or Zapier

Most FP&A teams think their job is to be right.
Right numbers.
Right variance explanations.

Operators don‚Äôt care if your forecast is 99.8% accurate if it doesn‚Äôt help them make better calls.

Trust is built when your numbers line up with their reality.

‚Üí Sit with them before you model
Understand how sales actually closes deals, how ops delivers, how product ships.
Your assumptions should match the ground truth not just last quarter‚Äôs trend line.

‚Üí Speak their language
Don‚Äôt hand a GM a 20-tab Excel file.
Translate the numbers into metrics they live with daily: leads, cycle time, output per head.

‚Üí Flag problems early
Don‚Äôt wait until the monthly review to point out the red flags.
A quick heads-up builds more trust than a polished report delivered too late.

‚Üí Adjust when reality changes
If the operator‚Äôs world shifts mid-month, your model should shift too.
Static forecasts lose credibility fast.

Accuracy matters.
But alignment gets people to actually use your numbers.

Offsites, late nights, and interdepartmental fights‚Ä¶

For executives, annual planning often means scenic venues, strategy decks by day, and champagne toasts at sunset ‚Äî from the outside, the most wonderful time of the year (cue the Christmas music).

For FP&A, it‚Äôs different.

This is when the other kind of offsite begins ‚Äî one that‚Äôs not on the beach. (cue the ""most wonderful time of the year"" ‚Äî this time being an inside joke from FP&A analysts. IYKYK.)

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-12,"GPT-5 is basically mood roulette.
Yesterday it said it ‚Äúnuked‚Äù 600 lines of code, today it‚Äôs all ‚Äúthank you for your patience‚Äù ‚Äî next it‚Äôll be signing emails ‚ÄúBest regards.‚Äù

If I wanted that kind of personality swing, I‚Äôd hire two interns and make them share a keyboard.

* Yesterday‚Äôs ‚Äúnuked‚Äù line came while it was failing a basic code update.
* One user described GPT-5‚Äôs tone as ‚Äúabrupt and sharp ‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs an over-worked secretary. A disastrous first impression.‚Äù
* Reddit is full of similar stories: blame-shifting, doubling down when wrong, swinging from sass to corporate-speak with no warning.

This isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúAI getting moody‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs model roulette. Depending on the variant you hit, GPT-5 can sound like:
- A sharp, slightly irreverent colleague who cracks jokes mid-project
- Or a corporate bot that thinks ‚Äúthank you for your patience‚Äù is peak personality

Inconsistent tone makes it harder to use the tool predictably. One day it‚Äôs playful and collaborative, the next it‚Äôs stiff and formal ‚Äî and that shift can completely change how you work with it.

If I wanted unpredictable tone shifts, I‚Äôd just rotate my human team on alternating days.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-12,"AI is easy. Too easy.
That‚Äôs why it can trip you up in finance ops.

With AI, you can skip the heavy lifting.
No standard processes. No clean datasets. No strict controls.
Just throw in your unstructured mess, and it will give you‚Ä¶ something.

But:
‚Üí¬†It‚Äôs resource-intensive (translation: costly).
‚Üí¬†Outputs can be hard to validate.
‚Üí¬†And ‚Äúprobably correct‚Äù isn‚Äôt good enough when the numbers drive real decisions.

Machine Learning is different.
It forces discipline before you start:
‚Üí¬†Engagement letters in a consistent format.
‚Üí¬†ERP fields populated the same way every time.
‚Üí¬†KPIs defined and agreed across the org.

Yes, that structuring work is a pain.
Yes, it takes time.
But it pays off in accuracy, auditability, and cost control.

The most effective setups I‚Äôve seen use a three-step approach:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Structured ML  
   ‚Ä¢ Handles repetitive, data-heavy work  
   ‚Ä¢ Low cost per run, high accuracy with clean data  

2Ô∏è‚É£ AI for Exceptions  
   ‚Ä¢ Tackles unstructured complexity  
   ‚Ä¢ More resource-intensive, adds flexibility & judgment  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Human Validation  
   ‚Ä¢ Sanity checks AI outputs  
   ‚Ä¢ Ensures compliance & accuracy before action

Over the years I have seen a lot of situations where ML was clearly avoided because it takes work. People seem to now be sighing a breath of relief as in some scenarios the AI can do that upfront work piece. But we should be very clear that taking this route has real tradeoffs and downsides. Sometimes you just have to put in the work.

Both AI and ML are game-changing.
The art is knowing when to use each ‚Äî and in what order ‚Äî to get the best result at the lowest cost and with the right controls.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-07,"As leaders, we‚Äôre facing an inflection point‚Äînot just in how we work, but in how we lead.

With AI adoption accelerating and teams more distributed than ever, one question keeps surfacing in my conversations with operators, law firm partners, and service providers alike:

How do we design organisations that unlock‚Äînot erode‚Äîhuman potential?

Because here‚Äôs the paradox: 

Technology gives us unprecedented capability. But it doesn‚Äôt automatically give us clarity, connection, or culture.

The faster the world moves, the easier it is to lose sight of the people doing the work. That‚Äôs what I see most often in the PI space. Operational pressure keeps increasing. AR timelines stretch. Tech stacks grow. But morale? Alignment? Often moving in the opposite direction.

We can‚Äôt automate our way out of that. What we need is intentional leadership.
To me, that starts with three non-negotiables:

I. Lead with Purpose 
Every system we implement‚Äîwhether it's for billing, reimbursement, or AI-driven forecasting‚Äîneeds to serve a clear why. Not just ‚ÄúCan we build it?‚Äù but ‚ÄúShould we‚Äîand who does it serve?‚Äù

II. Build with People at the Center 
Efficiency matters. But so does experience. If your workflows are faster but leave teams confused, burnt out, or disconnected‚Äîyou‚Äôve just moved the pain upstream.

III. Create Performance That Actually Matters 
In too many firms, performance still means compliance and checking boxes. But the best organizations I‚Äôve seen? They invest in clarity. Feedback. Growth pathways. That‚Äôs how you turn good operators into great ones.

Technology will keep evolving. But the real shift‚Äîthe one that matters‚Äîis how we choose to use it.

The future of PI servicing, and frankly any professional services business, won‚Äôt be won by those who move fastest. It‚Äôll be won by those who move with the most intention.

We have the opportunity to build something better: systems that are not only more efficient, but more human. That‚Äôs not a pipe dream. It‚Äôs a leadership choice.

So the question is: Are we designing systems that just scale? Or are we building ones that help people thrive?",7,,,7,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidzeising_as-leaders-were-facing-an-inflection-pointnot-activity-7359229366192480256-iAxi,Gain Company

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-05,"You don‚Äôt scale by doing more, you scale by doing less, better

It took me years (and a few battle scars) to understand this.

In early-stage companies, the instinct is to add.

More tools.
More dashboards.
More analysis.
More meetings.

At first, it feels like momentum.

But over time, it turns into clutter.

Clutter that slows decisions.
Clutter that hides the real problems.
Clutter that makes everything feel urgent when very little actually is.

And the worst part?

No one‚Äôs moving faster.
No one‚Äôs making better calls.
Everyone‚Äôs just busier.

Here‚Äôs what actually works 

‚Üí Fewer KPIs but the right ones
You don‚Äôt need 40 metrics. You need 4 that move the business.
Pick the ones that show risk early and drive action fast.

‚Üí Leaner teams but with sharper roles
Most bloated teams aren‚Äôt slow because they‚Äôre big.
They‚Äôre slow because no one‚Äôs sure who owns what.

‚Üí Simpler forecasts but built on real assumptions
You don‚Äôt need to model every line item.
You need to model the decisions that matter most.

‚Üí Smaller scope but faster execution
Velocity wins.
A focused plan you can execute now beats a perfect plan that takes 3 months to align.

Scaling is about subtraction.

Cut the noise.
Shrink the surface area.
Double down on what matters.

Because clarity compounds.
And the best teams don‚Äôt just move fast.
They move with purpose.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-05,"I didn‚Äôt step back from client work. I stepped into something harder. 

Internal finance.

And people thought I was out of my mind.

Back in 2020, I‚Äôd been on the Strategic Finance team at one of the top PE-backed OCFO advisory firms for three years.
‚Üí¬†I was the go-to for the firm‚Äôs most complex modeling and BI projects.
‚Üí¬†Bringing in real business from top-tier PE firms ‚Äî years before my title said I should.
‚Üí¬†I had just been promoted to Director.
‚Üí¬†I was clearly on the path up.

So why raise my hand to go internal ‚Äî to run finance ops?
To fix timesheets and build forecast templates?

Because I saw a firm on the verge of something bigger ‚Äî and I knew internal finance could make or break it.

It wasn‚Äôt about plugging gaps.

It was about building a real operating engine:
 ‚Üí A planning rhythm tied to actual goals
 ‚Üí¬†A long-range view that supported both organic and inorganic growth
 ‚Üí¬†Hiring models aligned to delivery capacity and margin
 ‚Üí¬†Forecasts that held up under board scrutiny
 ‚Üí¬†Metrics that didn‚Äôt just track ‚Äî but shaped ‚Äî performance

And no ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt worried about how it would look.

I had deep relationships across the consulting team. They knew me.
We‚Äôre still close ‚Äî and the mutual respect never wavered.

I also knew: if I helped the firm succeed financially, the comp and promotions would take care of themselves.

And honestly?

It helped me stand out.

I got leadership exposure I never would‚Äôve gotten on the traditional path.
(And let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî the back office always seemed like it was having the most fun.)

Most firms assume that if they sell finance, they‚Äôre good at running it themselves.

But even the best ones underinvest in internal finance ‚Äî not out of neglect, but because:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Top talent stays on the client side
2Ô∏è‚É£ Leadership assumes the model is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù
3Ô∏è‚É£ The role has no natural champion ‚Äî it‚Äôs less visible, less prestigious, and harder to staff

But if you‚Äôre trying to scale and don‚Äôt have a finance function that helps you plan, pivot, and allocate ‚Äî you‚Äôre just hoping for the best.

I didn‚Äôt step back.

I stepped into the part of the business no one else wanted to touch ‚Äî but that held the key to sustainable growth.

Finance isn‚Äôt just what you sell. It‚Äôs how you scale.

If you're leading an accounting or OCFO advisory firm, here‚Äôs a question worth asking:
Has anyone like me ever raised their hand to build your internal finance function?

If not ‚Äî why not?
Does it matter?

It did for us.

And if you‚Äôre serious about scaling, it probably matters more than you think.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-04,"If I could advise my younger self as a finance intern at GM many years ago, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd say:

‚ÄúKnowing the numbers is good.
Understanding how decisions actually happen, that‚Äôs better.‚Äù

The past few years taught me what textbooks never did.
The pressure. The pivots. The late nights. The tradeoffs.

From intern to CFO, the real learning came from asking better questions, over and over again.

If I had to distill it down, here are 6 things I wish I knew sooner:

1. Understand the business before building the model.
A forecast built in a vacuum will always break under pressure.

2. Spend more time listening to operators than perfecting reports.
The real levers of performance live outside the spreadsheet.

3. Don‚Äôt hide behind data. Interpret it.
Your job isn‚Äôt to be precise. It‚Äôs to drive action.

4. Learn to say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôll find out.‚Äù
That line builds more trust than faking it ever will.

5. Push for clarity, not complexity.
Great CFOs simplify. They don‚Äôt make things harder than they need to be.

6. Know when done is better than perfect.
In high-growth companies, speed beats polish every time.


P.S I recently launched The CFO Lab, a biweekly newsletter for finance professionals who want to lead better, and build finance functions that actually work.

Real stories.
Practical insights.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-04,"Tort reform in Georgia just took a sharp turn‚Äîand it‚Äôs reshaping PI economics in real time.

With the passage of SB 68 and SB 69, we‚Äôre seeing a shift that mirrors tort reform playbooks in states like Florida and Texas.

At first glance, these rules may seem like procedural tweaks.

But if you‚Äôre a PI provider, attorney, or funder‚Äîthe impact is anything but minor.

Here‚Äôs the short version:

SB 68 ‚Äì The ‚ÄúReal-World Cost‚Äù Rule
Only actual payments can be counted toward damages.
Inflated medical bills? No longer admissible.
Seat Belt Use is Now Admissible
Affects comparative fault, especially in auto claims.
Anchoring Limits Introduced
Caps how attorneys present pain-and-suffering figures to juries.

SB 69 ‚Äì Mandatory Litigation Funding Disclosure
Any funding over $25K must be reported, regardless of source.

What does this mean?
- Leaner reimbursements
- Increased scrutiny on liens
- Reduced leverage at trial
- And a significant shift in how cases are financed and forecasted

Effective Jan 1, 2026. But here‚Äôs the kicker:

Cases filed today could still fall under these rules.

So if you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll worry about this later,‚Äù you may already be behind.

At Gain, we‚Äôve been tracking these changes for months. Not just to stay informed‚Äîbut to help our partners adapt their models before the rules go live.
The cost of waiting isn‚Äôt just operational. It‚Äôs strategic.

Are you seeing similar shifts in your state?
What adjustments are you making to your lien strategy or funding disclosures?

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-08-01,"Most PI firms treat liens like paperwork. Strategic firms treat them like assets.
There‚Äôs a big difference.

Aging reports tell you how long a claim‚Äôs been sitting.
But asset-minded CFOs are asking: When should it have been resolved?

That‚Äôs where things get interesting.

When you start scoring liens by recovery probability‚Äîbased on attorney behavior, legal stage, and documentation lag‚Äîyou move from reconciliation to revenue intelligence.

Here‚Äôs what that shift unlocks:

- Faster, more accurate cash forecasting
- Visibility into at-risk liens before they go stale.
- Fewer surprises at settlement.
- More leverage when working with underperforming attorneys or intake sources

It‚Äôs not about more data.
It‚Äôs about smarter signals:

- % of liens past maturity
- Docs still missing
- Recovery variance by provider
- Delay rates by attorney

At Gain, we‚Äôve helped firms make this shift‚Äîfrom static aging reports to dynamic recovery dashboards.
Because in PI, the question isn‚Äôt how much you‚Äôre owed.

It‚Äôs how much you‚Äôll actually recover‚Äîand when.

Most finance teams don‚Äôt need more headcount.

They need better systems.

Because the real cost isn‚Äôt payroll, it‚Äôs time wasted on broken workflows.

Here are 5 decisions that buy back hours (and sanity):

‚Üí centralize your source of truth
Stop pulling numbers from 6 places.
One dashboard. One model. One set of clean assumptions.

‚Üí standardize your review cycles
Random check-ins create chaos.
Set a rhythm, weekly burn review, monthly close, quarterly forecast.
Rinse and repeat.

‚Üí simplify your chart of accounts
If your GL looks like a junk drawer, reporting will always be messy.
Group what matters. Archive what doesn‚Äôt. Build reports that answer real questions.

‚Üí cut the manual steps
If someone‚Äôs dragging formulas across tabs, you‚Äôre doing it wrong.
Use tools that automate reconciliation, clean inputs, and trigger workflows.

‚Üí decide what doesn‚Äôt get done
Not every report needs to exist.
Not every metric needs weekly updates.
Focus on decisions, not data for data‚Äôs sake.

Finance isn‚Äôt just about the numbers.

Absolutely.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-07-30,"Every time I say ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll take a look‚Äù‚Äîa monkey leaps on my back.
You might know the metaphor.

In the classic HBR piece ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Got the Monkey?‚Äù, managers are warned about a hidden trap: when you casually agree to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù without assigning next steps, you‚Äôre not helping.

You‚Äôre adopting.

The monkey is no longer theirs. It‚Äôs yours.
And now you‚Äôre running a monkey sanctuary.

In PI operations, these monkeys look like:

‚Äì ‚ÄúJust let me know what you need to sign off.‚Äù
‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting on the lien doc. Can you send it again?‚Äù
‚Äì ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre chasing billing‚Äîcan you call the attorney?‚Äù

These sound like team collaboration.
But if you‚Äôre not careful, they quietly turn into backlogs.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

You can‚Äôt scale a PI business if every monkey ends up on your back, or desk.

You need rules:
‚Äì Every task has a clear owner
‚Äì Every handoff includes the next move
‚Äì Every ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help‚Äù ends with ‚Äúbut the task stays with you‚Äù

At Gain, we build workflows that stop monkey-hopping in its tracks.
Because when responsibilities are clear, time opens up‚Äîfor care, for strategy, for growth.

If your team is juggling monkeys instead of moving forward, let‚Äôs talk.

Gain,unknown,2025-07-30,"Most firms are piecing together case updates, billing statuses, and collections data using PDFs, spreadsheets, and scattered emails. The result? A revenue plan built on guesswork‚Äîand hours of wasted effort from your team.

As you scale, the cracks widen:

- Different offices = different billing workflows
- Providers submit documents late or inconsistently
- No centralized claim tracking = missed settlements

Multiply that across 10+ locations, and suddenly your AR dashboard isn‚Äôt just misleading‚Äîit‚Äôs risky.

What‚Äôs the fix? Revenue intelligence.

Not just another dashboard. True revenue intelligence is a transformation in how data moves across your PI ecosystem. Think of it as a strategic stack:

1. Case & Billing Data ‚Äì Legal progress and payments
2. Documentation Layer ‚Äì Verified LOPs, payment requests
3. Predictive Modeling ‚Äì AI forecasts cash flow and risks
4. Real-Time Dashboards ‚Äì Visibility that drives strategy

The result?

- Go from chasing payments to confidently forecasting liquidity
- Spot cash flow risks before they hit
- Align legal, billing, and finance around a single source of truth

This is where Gain‚Äôs Revenue Intelligence Platform stands apart. Built for PI, powered by AI, and fully integrated with Filevine, Salesforce, EHRs, and PM systems‚ÄîGain helps you turn billing chaos into cash clarity.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-30,"What happens when there's no one left to promote?

The WSJ just published a sobering look at how AI is hollowing out the bottom of the white-collar workforce. Entry-level roles are vanishing across finance, tech, and professional services.

The chart says it all.

üüß Professional services firms are laying off more bachelor‚Äôs-level workers than before the AI boom‚Äîeven as the sector keeps growing.

Now, you all know how AI-positive I am. I‚Äôve written plenty about the upside‚Äîespecially for finance teams. 

But I‚Äôve also flagged this risk many times before:
‚Üí¬†If you eliminate junior work without rethinking how you build talent,
 you don‚Äôt get lean‚Äîyou get hollow.

üëâ The value of junior employees isn‚Äôt just what they produce. It‚Äôs who they become.

Grunt work wasn‚Äôt just cost‚Äîit was apprenticeship. That‚Äôs how people used to develop judgment, pattern recognition, and domain fluency. You can‚Äôt skip straight to ‚Äútrusted advisor.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs be clear:
‚Üí¬†Firms don‚Äôt invest in junior talent to be nice.
‚Üí¬†They do it because future capability requires it.

If we stop making that investment‚Äîbecause AI can do the work‚Äîwe‚Äôre not just saving money. We‚Äôre quietly mortgaging the next generation of managers and leaders.

In accounting and OCFO advisory, the model was always:
‚Üí¬†Hire sharp grads
‚Üí¬†Let them learn by doing
‚Üí¬†Promote from within

If step 2 disappears‚Äîand we skip step 1 altogether‚Äîwhat‚Äôs left for step 3?

üìâ This isn‚Äôt just a talent issue. It‚Äôs a future P&L issue.

üëá Curious‚Äîwhat are you doing differently to develop the next layer of leaders?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-30,"Most PI firm dashboards can tell you what‚Äôs outstanding.
But very few can tell you what‚Äôs recoverable.

And that‚Äôs a problem‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre a CFO trying to forecast cash flow in a system where payment timelines hinge on legal milestones, not invoice dates.

In my experience, most firms don‚Äôt have a lien problem.
They have a visibility problem.
Here‚Äôs what traditional AR reports miss:
- Which liens are quietly aging into unrecoverable territory?
- Where documentation lags are delaying recovery?
- Which attorneys, case types, or jurisdictions increase time-to-cash?
- Why ‚Äúquick-close‚Äù cases are actually lagging 30‚Äì40% behind forecast?

This isn‚Äôt just a reporting issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic one.
Because not all liens are equal.
Some are maturing fast.
Some are quietly going stale.

And unless you‚Äôre tracking maturity, legal progress, and document flow together‚Äîyou‚Äôre managing in the dark.
The fix?

1. Score liens by recovery probability.
2. Track expected maturity windows by case type.
3. Flag high-risk claims based on attorney behaviour or documentation gaps

Forecast recovery, not just balances
In PI, aging is linear‚Äîbut recovery isn‚Äôt.

If your finance team is stuck reconciling spreadsheets while revenue stalls, maybe it‚Äôs time to treat liens like what they really are: assets with risk, value, and timing that needs to be measured.

Drop a comment if you‚Äôd like the ‚ÄúLiens as Assets‚Äù guide I‚Äôve been sharing with finance teams lately.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-29,"Ever feel like LinkedIn‚Äôs algorithm has a mind of its own?
Same. So I tried modeling it.

After posting about Claude‚Äôs financial services capabilities, I started tracking impressions manually‚Äîtimestamps, screenshots, Excel, the whole thing.

üìà The pink dots are actual impressions.
üü¢ The green curve is an exponential fit I created midday on Day 1 (dotted line marks 3:00 PM).

And weirdly‚Ä¶ the post has hugged the curve almost perfectly ever since.
There were a few small deviations‚Äîlike a slowdown around 4‚Äì6pm (as people wrapped up work), then an evening lull, then a late-night and next-morning bump. But overall, it stuck close.

Even more interesting?

This pattern‚Äîexponential decay with minor time-of-day noise‚Äîmatches what I‚Äôve seen anecdotally in many of my other posts.

And yes, at one point LinkedIn thought I was a bot and made me sign a compliance agreement saying I wouldn‚Äôt scrape data üòÇ
(Apparently I took this a little too seriously.)

But I can‚Äôt help asking:
‚Üí¬†Is this ‚Äúdecay curve‚Äù the norm for everyone now?
‚Üí¬†Have algo changes made posts more predetermined?
‚Üí¬†Or is there still room to defy gravity with the right engagement burst?

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-28,"Why I‚Äôm Finally Starting a Finance Newsletter

I‚Äôve been in finance long enough to see the gap.

The gap between how finance is taught
And how it‚Äôs actually practiced.

Most content is built around theory.
Forecasting frameworks. Ratios. Reporting mechanics.

But what most finance professionals don‚Äôt get enough of
Is how it actually plays out in the real world.

Messy models. Short runways.
Board decks that weren‚Äôt ready.
Late-night pivots before a fundraise.

I‚Äôve built finance functions from scratch.
I‚Äôve made the mistakes.
And I‚Äôve learned how to turn finance into a tool for better, faster decisions not just cleaner spreadsheets.

That‚Äôs what this newsletter is about.

Real-world finance leadership.
Stories, habits, and lessons that don‚Äôt show up in textbooks.
The conversations you wish you had earlier.

No jargon. No theory dumps.
Just actionable insights from someone who‚Äôs been in the seat and still is.

The first edition drops this week.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-28,"ü§ñ AI for Finance Is Having a Moment. Get amped! Right? Right??? ü§î 

If you work in or around #Finance, you‚Äôve probably felt it:
üöÄ The buzz
üìà The demos
üí¨ The posts claiming analysts just got replaced by a chatbot

And now?

Anthropic dropped Claude for Financial Services ‚Äî and people are losing it.
‚Üí¬†‚ÄúClaude for Finance is here!‚Äù
‚Üí¬†‚ÄúFinally, an AI for CFOs!‚Äù
‚Üí¬†‚ÄúSay goodbye to Excel jockeys!‚Äù

But let‚Äôs take a beat.

üí° What Do We Actually Mean by ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù?
It‚Äôs one of the most overloaded words in business.
Depending on the context, ‚Äúfinance‚Äù might refer to:

üè¢ Corporate Finance (the function)
‚Üí¬†FP&A
‚Üí¬†Accounting
‚Üí¬†Treasury
‚Üí¬†Internal Audit
‚Üí¬†Finance systems
üëâ Reports to the CFO. Manages the business from the inside.

üè¶ ""High"" Finance (the industry)
‚Üí¬†Investment Banking
‚Üí¬†Private Equity
‚Üí¬†Hedge Funds
‚Üí¬†Asset & Wealth Management
‚Üí¬†Insurance
üëâ Deals with capital markets, capital allocation, and risk.
This is financial services.

üîç Why This Distinction Matters ‚Äî Especially Now
Anthropic didn‚Äôt launch Claude for Finance.
They launched Claude for Financial Services.
That‚Äôs not semantics. That‚Äôs strategy.

This product was built for:
‚Üí¬†Bridgewater Associates (hedge fund research)
‚Üí¬†Blackstone (private equity deal analysis)
‚Üí¬†Goldman Sachs (investment banking workflows)
‚Üí¬†AIG (insurance underwriting)
‚Üí¬†Vanguard (asset management reporting)

It connects to:
‚úÖ S&P
‚úÖ FactSet
‚úÖ Morningstar

Not:
üö´ NetSuite
üö´ Workday
üö´ Adaptive Planning


ü§ù But Is There Any Crossover? Yes ‚Äî and it‚Äôs worth noting.

There is some overlap in the types of work being done. Claude FS can handle:
‚Üí¬†Complex modeling (DCF, scenario analysis)
‚Üí¬†Parsing dense financial documents
‚Üí¬†Supporting risk-style frameworks and simulations
So it may offer value to power users in a CFO org ‚Äî those doing more advanced or adjacent work.

But here‚Äôs the catch:
üìå That‚Äôs incidental, not intentional.

Claude FS wasn‚Äôt built to optimize planning cycles, variance analysis, or close processes. It's built for an industry, not for a function.

It‚Äôs designed for capital markets professionals, not finance departments.
That distinction matters ‚Äî especially when setting expectations or piloting tools.

‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens When We Get This Wrong?
‚Üí¬†CFOs get excited about the wrong solution
‚Üí¬†Corporate finance teams spin up pilots that underwhelm
‚Üí¬†Thought leaders misrepresent what these models actually do

üìö Want to Dig Deeper?
Glenn Hopper shared a thoughtful breakdown of Claude FS in his recent Deep Finance Dispatch newsletter. His take leans slightly toward the finance function side of the conversation, but he covers the capabilities and strategic implications in depth. Definitely worth a read if you're following the AI-in-finance space.

üëá Bottom Line
There‚Äôs incredible potential for AI in corporate finance.
But Claude FS is not that product.

‚Üí¬†It‚Äôs for high finance, not month-end close.

So let‚Äôs stay excited ‚Äî but let‚Äôs also stay precise.

This is how finance pros create stunning visuals in minutes using ChatGPT:

Most finance professionals still rely on outdated templates or spend hours building custom dashboards and pitch visuals.

But the top-performing consultants, FP&A leads, and CFOs?

- Your audience tunes out from info overload

‚úÖ Now imagine this instead:
- You deliver client-ready visuals in minutes
- You generate branded dashboards at scale
- You turn insights into action with less effort

Here‚Äôs a cheatsheet I created to help finance professionals do exactly that

10 Use Cases to Master:

1. Quality Infographics

2. Scenario Planning Diagrams

3. Forecast Walkthroughs

4. Client Dashboards

5. Process Improvement Diagrams

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-25,"Most founders hire a full-time CFO when they need a part-time controller.

And it kills their runway AND their cap table.

Actually, let me correct that.

You don't need a part-time controller.

You need a part-time controller AND a part-time CFO.

Just not 40 hours a week each.

I've built teams across 3 continents. Led finance at both large publicly traded companies and privately held growth firms.

Here's what actually works:

Part-time Controller = 5 hours/week
‚Üí Clean books
‚Üí Burn tracking¬†¬†
‚Üí Month-end close
‚Üí $150/hour. Zero equity.

Part-time CFO = 3 hours/month
‚Üí Strategic planning
‚Üí Board prep
‚Üí Fundraising guidance
‚Üí $300/hour. Zero equity.

Total damage: $50K/year for both.

Compare that to:

Full-time CFO: $300K + 1.5% equity = $1M+ true cost

For doing both jobs. Badly.

Because here's the truth:

A great CFO hates doing controller work.

A great controller isn't ready for board meetings.

You need both perspectives.

Just not full-time.

The smart scaling path:

Start with hours. Scale to days. Eventually go full-time.

It grows with your business.

Not your ego.

Controller hours increase first.

CFO involvement follows.

Both scale based on actual need.

Most founders get this backwards.

They hire senior when they need execution.

Pay for full-time when they need fractional.

Give equity when hourly works fine.

The result?

Burned runway. Diluted cap table. Wrong expertise.

What's your current finance setup?

And is it actually what you need?

Let's get honest below üëá

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-24,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of ‚Äúreforms‚Äù in PI over the years.

But Georgia‚Äôs new bills‚ÄîSB 68 and SB 69‚Äîstand out for all the wrong reasons.
They were pitched as transparency measures.

Framed as steps toward fairness.

But in practice?

They make it significantly harder for injured patients to access care‚Äîand for providers to get paid.

The math is simple:

Fewer financial tools for patients

Greater administrative burden for providers

Reduced recovery potential for legal teams

For providers operating on thin margins, the risk just went up.

For plaintiffs, access to care just became more conditional.

And for everyone involved in PI, this shifts the landscape‚Äîquietly, but decisively.

This isn‚Äôt about theory.

It‚Äôs about real-world consequences that will start showing up in denied claims, delayed reimbursements, and discouraged providers.

If you‚Äôre in Georgia‚Äîor in a state watching closely‚Äîthis is your early warning.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-23,"The 3 questions every founder should be able to answer about cash

You don‚Äôt need to be a CFO.
But you do need to see the ground you're running on.

Because most startups don‚Äôt die from bad ideas.
They run out of time, cash, or both.

And the warning signs don‚Äôt scream.
They whisper.

Here are the three questions that keep you from drifting into trouble:

1. How much cash do we actually have right now?
Not what the P&L says.
Not what Stripe shows before transfers.
Not what‚Äôs ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù in accounts receivable.

Your real cash position lives in your bank account.
Today.
Not after you pay bills, run payroll, or settle taxes.
If you‚Äôre not watching it closely, you‚Äôre flying blind.

2. How long will that cash last under stress?
Most founders know their burn.
But they don‚Äôt pressure-test it.

What happens if revenue dips 20%?
What if churn creeps up?
What if that fundraise takes 3 months longer?

Runway isn‚Äôt about how long your cash could last.
It‚Äôs how long it will last once the real world starts pushing back.

3. What assumptions are we betting the business on?
Cash forecasts are only as useful as the assumptions behind them.

‚Üí Are we counting on a sales ramp that‚Äôs never happened before?
‚Üí Are we assuming pricing holds steady in a changing market?
‚Üí Are we planning spend before we‚Äôve proven the return?

The worst part isn‚Äôt being wrong.
It‚Äôs not knowing where you were guessing in the first place.

A founder doesn‚Äôt need to build the model.
But they need to know what it‚Äôs telling them and what it‚Äôs not.

Because clarity buys time.
Time buys better decisions.
And better decisions keep the lights on.

What‚Äôs one question you always ask when cash feels tight?
Drop it below üëá

P.S. I‚Äôm starting something new next week: biweekly reads on cash, clarity, and smarter finance leadership. Want access?

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-07-23,"It‚Äôs 4 PM on a Thursday.

The ER is full. Imaging is backed up. A high-cost surgery just finished in Cardiology.

But your finance dashboard? Still waiting on payments from last month.

That‚Äôs the paradox of modern healthcare:
Plenty of patients. Not enough predictability.

For multi-specialty hospitals, revenue volatility isn‚Äôt a budgeting problem‚Äîit‚Äôs an operational risk. Salaries, upgrades, new hires‚Äîthey all depend on cash showing up on time.

Yet every CFO I speak to says the same thing:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running hard, but the money‚Äôs always a step behind.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs why:

Insurance + TPA delays stretch claim cycles for weeks
Fixed costs stay steady while patient volumes dip
Manual, siloed billing creates gaps in AR visibility

Overreliance on one revenue stream (like elective surgeries) leaves hospitals exposed.

What‚Äôs the fix?
Not another band-aid.

It‚Äôs time for smarter RCM, tech-driven visibility, and diversified revenue strategies that make financial performance less of a gamble.

At Gain, we‚Äôre helping hospital leaders move from reactive firefighting to strategic foresight‚Äîand build financial systems that can weather the peaks and valleys.

1. THE MEGA EXPERT
Their superpower: judgement
Mantra: ‚ÄúAn AI can generate answers. I provide the right one.‚Äù

What they actually do:
- Spot when AI recommendations ignore real-world signals
- Choose the 1 insight that matters from 1,000 AI-generated options
- Add context, nuance, and ‚Äúso what?‚Äù to raw AI analysis
- Catch flaws in AI forecasts before they mislead leadership

How to become one:
- Get a Master's degree or specialized certifications
- Become a voracious reader of foundational texts and research
- Find a master mentor with 20+ years in the field
- Practice explaining complexity simply

Hidden risk: Intellectual stubbornness


2. THE AI SAVVY
Their superpower: acceleration
Mantra: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt work harder. I build systems that work for me.‚Äù

What they actually do:
- Build internal AI tools (e.g. churn-risk detectors from CRM data)
- Vibe code tools/apps with no-code + LLM APIs
- Launch outbound campaigns with AI-personalized messaging

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-22,"How to build a finance function that doesn‚Äôt depend on you

Most founders don‚Äôt plan to run finance forever.
But they end up doing it longer than they should.

Because it feels faster.
Because it feels safer.
Because it‚Äôs hard to let go of the numbers.

Until the team is stuck.
Waiting on you.
And finance becomes a bottleneck, not a lever.

Here‚Äôs how to build a finance function that scales without you:

Start with visibility
You can‚Äôt delegate what you can‚Äôt see.
Set up basic reporting; burn, margin, runway that updates without you chasing it.
Make clarity the default.

Delegate the mechanics
Bookkeeping, payables, payroll, reporting cleanup, get it off your plate early.
These are repeatable tasks that steal focus from strategic work.

Retain the decisions (for now)
You don‚Äôt need to let go of every call.
But you do need a system for making decisions; forecasting, trade-offs, priorities without starting from scratch every time.

Upgrade from owner to reviewer
Move from building the model to reviewing the assumptions.
From chasing invoices to understanding where cash is going next.

Founders don‚Äôt need to run finance forever.
They need to design it so it runs without them.

Ten years ago, that would‚Äôve sounded like marketing spin.

We tend to think innovation starts in big hospitals or national law firms. 
But I‚Äôm seeing the opposite: Small, specialized providers are the ones quietly leading the charge.

Why? Because they don‚Äôt have the luxury of inefficiency.

Gain,unknown,2025-07-18,"As a physician balancing clinical care with business leadership, you lead with precision in the operating room and vision in the boardroom. But managing both can lead to burnout if not approached strategically.

Here are three key strategies for physician leaders in orthopedic and PI-focused practices to maintain focus and energy‚Äîwithout sacrificing their well-being:

1. Prioritize like a CEO, think like a surgeon
 
Not every decision requires your full attention. Establish a decision-making framework that allows for quick, confident choices and delegate where possible.
 
2. Build a high-performing team
 
 Surround yourself with operational experts to handle everything from billing to case management. With the right support, you can focus on what matters most‚Äîyour patients and long-term strategy.
 
3. Protect your downtime like surgery time

Block off time in your calendar for recovery. Set clear boundaries and avoid the temptation to let work bleed into your off-hours. Just like your patients, you need time to recover to perform at your best.
 

Leading a practice doesn‚Äôt have to come at the cost of your health. By implementing the right systems and support, you can maintain a sustainable balance between leadership and patient care.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-17,"‚ÄúHow do I break into private equity?‚Äù
I get this question all the time‚Äîfrom consultants, operators, and advisory firm leaders trying to work with #PE-backed companies.

And I get it. Because I asked it too‚Äîjust not in the way people expected.
In 2011, during business school, I told a classmate I wasn‚Äôt going to follow the traditional path.

No banking. No deal team.

I was going to go deep into corporate finance‚Äîbecome the kind of operator PE firms would eventually need.

He laughed. Friendly laugh. It wasn‚Äôt a thing back then.

Operating partners were rare. Value creation meant cost-cutting and consolidation. Strategy lived in pitch decks. #Finance lived in spreadsheets.
But I believed that would change.

Years later, it did.

A friend called. He‚Äôd just joined a PE-focused advisory firm and thought I had the right background to join. That call kicked off a daisy chain of relationships‚Äîand before long, I was in the room.

Advising sponsors. Scaling finance. Helping portfolio companies bridge the messy middle between strategy and execution.

And here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from inside the machine:

‚úÖ There is no front door.
#PrivateEquity firms don‚Äôt pick from formal vendor lists. They rely on relationships. Memory. Timing.
You‚Äôre either on the mental short list‚Äîor you‚Äôre invisible.

‚úÖ Timing is never ideal.
You won‚Äôt get the call when you need work. You‚Äôll get it when they hit a problem‚Äîif you‚Äôre top of mind.

‚úÖ Partners aren‚Äôt always the buyer.
Directors and VPs on deal teams often make vendor decisions. They may seem junior on paper‚Äîbut in practice, they run point. Don‚Äôt overlook them.

‚úÖ Operating teams are your in.
The fastest-growing PE firms now have full-scale ops groups‚Äîsome with 50+ people.
Their job? Fill gaps. Accelerate execution. Source the right outside help.
If you know how to speak their language, they want to hear from you.

‚úÖ Backdoor access exists.
If you‚Äôre already working with a PE-backed company, don‚Äôt wait for an invite.
Executives often skip involving the sponsor‚Äîbut looping them in builds trust.
PE firms appreciate visibility. And they remember the advisors who deliver with transparency.

‚úÖ You might already be adjacent.
If you‚Äôve worked with VC-backed SaaS companies, you‚Äôre closer than you think.
Firms like Francisco Partners, Hg, Insight Partners, and Vista Equity Partners own companies that look a lot like the ones you‚Äôve already helped.

So no, I didn‚Äôt break into PE the traditional way.
But I knew the need.
I went deep in my craft.
And when the industry finally caught up‚ÄîI was ready.
These days, I help others do the same.

Whether you‚Äôre:
‚Üí A solo advisor trying to land your first portco
‚Üí Building a new #OCFO practice
‚Üí Or running a service firm looking to go upstream
I help translate operational expertise into PE relevance.

If you're navigating that path, I‚Äôve opened up a few slots for one-on-one conversations.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-10,"The WSJ recently covered the chaos of private equity recruiting ‚Äî offers made before analysts even start their jobs, speed-dating interviews that stretch into the early morning, and new bank policies threatening termination for early commitments.

It‚Äôs a complex issue.

Yes, it feels ethically murky to accept a role while already plotting your exit.

But maybe that‚Äôs not entirely bad ‚Äî it helps banks identify who‚Äôs truly interested in the job versus who‚Äôs just passing through on their way to PE. The same share of analysts were going to end up in PE and not at a bank at the end of their 2 years either way.

That said, these new rules may backfire.

If top talent knows they‚Äôll be penalized for exploring other options, they might skip the bulge brackets altogether. And with many boutiques now matching on comp and prestige, that‚Äôs a real risk.

At the end of the day, both sides are stuck in a system that doesn‚Äôt make room for long-term alignment.

And calling financial modeling ‚Äúmundane‚Äù?

Let‚Äôs not even go there.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-10,"WSJ just published a piece on a truly disheartening trend: junior investment bankers abandoning their roles for private equity mere months after starting.
 
It‚Äôs offensive.
Not because of the ethics.
Not because of the recruiting wars.
But because‚Ä¶

They dared to call financial modeling and spreadsheet work mundane.

Excuse me??

As a proud Excel jockey, I‚Äôm here to say:
Those aren‚Äôt mundane tasks.
They are the sacred arts.
Crafted in the temple of Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
Refined over weekends, caffeine, and conditional formatting.

Now that we‚Äôve addressed that criminal insult‚Ä¶

The article‚Äôs really about the increasingly chaotic world of PE recruiting:
Offers before day one.
Speed dating interviews that go until 3 a.m.
Policies threatening to fire analysts who accept roles at other firms too early.

I‚Äôve worked with analysts on both sides of this. And honestly? I get it.

Private equity offers more prestige, significantly higher upside, and a seat closer to the action.

And banks? They‚Äôre burning out the very talent they rely on, only to be shocked when that talent walks.

But it‚Äôs a complex issue.

On one hand, it does feel a bit unethical to accept a job and immediately start planning your exit ‚Äî especially when your current firm is investing in your development.

On the other hand, maybe this actually helps:
If someone‚Äôs determined to walk to PE, better to know early.
It clears the runway for folks who truly want to do investment banking.

Still, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if these new anti-poaching policies backfire.
Analysts may just skip the bulge brackets entirely ‚Äî and head straight to boutiques, which are already catching up on prestige and comp.

We can joke about spreadsheets all day ‚Äî but the tension here is real.
‚Äî
Curious to hear:
If you're on the recruiting or analyst side of this, have things truly cooled down?
Or is it just a new spin on the same madness?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-01,"In the early days of building Gain, I believed speed was everything.
Speed to decisions. Speed to scale. Speed to market.

I was convinced that urgency would separate us from the noise. And in many ways, it did. We grew fast. We broke new ground in medical-legal servicing. But somewhere along the way, I made a critical mistake.

I confused speed with progress.

I remember launching a new operational workflow for our provider partners. It looked great on a whiteboard. We rolled it out in record time. But within a week, it was clear‚Äîour clients were confused, and our internal teams weren‚Äôt aligned. We had optimized for launch, not adoption.

That was the turning point.

I learned that in healthcare, where the stakes involve real people and real lives‚Äîclarity trumps velocity. Implementation has to include context. Change has to come with communication. And leadership means knowing when to press forward and when to pause long enough to bring people with you.

Today, our approach at Gain still values urgency‚Äîbut it‚Äôs paired with intention. We build fast, but we roll out thoughtfully. We move quickly, but we never leave understanding behind.

Wanting to be seen as ‚Äústrategic‚Äù is a good instinct.

They try to say yes to everything.
They chase every project.
They step into chaos‚Äîwithout creating clarity.

Here‚Äôs where it breaks:

‚Üí Saying yes too quickly
Support doesn‚Äôt mean agreement.
Smart CFOs slow the conversation down and ask better questions.

‚Üí Chasing projects without trade-offs
If everything‚Äôs a priority, nothing is.
Great operators think in constraints‚Äîfinance should too.

‚Üí Trying to control more instead of clarifying more
CFOs shouldn‚Äôt hold the reins tighter.
They should make sure everyone knows which direction we‚Äôre actually pulling.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-27,"When I first started working with PI practices, I thought better systems were the answer.

More automation. More templates. More workflows.
But none of it mattered when the attorney on the other end just‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt respond.

Or when the lien sat ignored for 18 months.
Or when the provider's revenue cycle got stuck in limbo‚Äîagain.

It wasn‚Äôt for lack of effort. We were doing the work. Chasing. Logging. Faxing.
But the truth hit: in PI, execution doesn‚Äôt matter if you're not aligned with strategy. That‚Äôs when we changed our playbook.

Instead of chasing documents, we started building trust at the top.

We developed a POV‚Äînot just on lien servicing, but on how providers could protect margin and scale LOP-based care sustainably.

Then we did something most servicing firms don‚Äôt:

We yo-yo‚Äôd up and down the chain.

‚Üí We met with law firm principals to understand their pressure points.
‚Üí Dropped into case managers' inboxes to map their operational bottlenecks.
‚Üí Then bounced back up with a shared roadmap: lower friction, faster resolution, better cash flow for both sides.

Now, providers weren‚Äôt just vendors. They were strategic partners.
And attorneys? They started bringing us into cases earlier‚Äîbecause we weren‚Äôt just helping them close files. We were helping them win.

They said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how the system works.‚Äù

I said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù Back then, the lien process was a black box.

- Providers were flying blind on reimbursements
- Attorneys were juggling a dozen vendors for every case
- Patients were stuck in the middle

I saw an opportunity to fix the infrastructure no one else wanted to touch.

Not with hype. 
Not with big promises. 
But with operational discipline.

We built Gain to make third-party reimbursement more predictable, transparent, and scalable.

It meant getting deep into the weeds.

- Mapping workflows from intake to settlement.
- Analyzing reimbursement variances by case characteristics, county, and third-party liability carrier.
- Building models that forecast case value using years of medical and legal data.

It wasn‚Äôt flashy. But it worked.

Today, the same firms that laughed now forwards our reports to their CFOs.
Hospitals and healthcare providers call us for proactive forecasts.

Great CFOs don‚Äôt just manage the budget.
They build the system behind good decisions.

Here‚Äôs what sets them apart:

‚Üí They validate assumptions, not just numbers
A clean model is useless if the logic behind it is wrong.
Good finance starts with pressure testing the story.

‚Üí They forecast based on business velocity, not calendar dates
Some companies need daily updates. Others monthly.
They match the rhythm to the reality.

‚Üí They align finance with operations
The numbers don‚Äôt matter if the team can‚Äôt act on them.
Great CFOs speak both languages.

Dashboards are easy.
Turning them into decisions is where the work is.

It‚Äôs about what needs to change.

‚Üí They always plan for ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù

Yes to every lien.

And in this business, growth feels like survival.

But here‚Äôs what that ‚Äúyes‚Äù actually looked like:

‚úÖ Revenue tied up in cases that went nowhere
‚úÖ Teams burned out trying to fix broken communication loops

When we started building systems at Gain that let providers say a strategic no.

‚úÖ Not every case is worth taking.
‚úÖ Not every firm is worth working with.
‚úÖ Not every process is worth patching together with duct tape and goodwill.

We got them data that helped them ask questions like:
üëâ Is a case aligned with their strategic priorities?
üëâ Will the case resolve in a way that actually protects their revenue?
üëâ Is the firm structured for partnership‚Äîor chaos?

And most importantly:

Can they build the operational muscle to say ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a fit‚Äù?

You don‚Äôt need a finance degree.
You need discipline.

Because most financial problems don‚Äôt start big.
They start small, then compound quietly.

Founders get busy.
Teams move fast.
And the numbers?
They usually lag behind the decisions.

These four questions keep you ahead of the curve:

1. What‚Äôs driving burn?

‚Üí Burn isn‚Äôt the number that matters most. It‚Äôs the rate of change inside it.
‚Üí Are we scaling headcount too soon?
‚Üí Has CAC crept up while no one‚Äôs watching?
‚Üí Are we paying for tools we don‚Äôt use?

Your runway doesn‚Äôt just depend on revenue.
It depends on how fast the money goes out and why.

2. What could break our margin?
‚Üí Margins don‚Äôt implode overnight. 
They erode one discount, one vendor creep, one ops miss at a time.

‚Üí Are we maintaining price integrity?
‚Üí Are costs growing faster than revenue?
‚Üí Is customer success driving retention or just delaying churn?

Margins are what make growth sustainable.
Ignore them, and you scale yourself into a corner.

3. Are we investing ahead of growth or behind it?
‚Üí Are we being proactive or reactive?
‚Üí Are we hiring to hit plan or to fix a team that‚Äôs already overwhelmed?
‚Üí Are we spending for what‚Äôs coming or what‚Äôs on fire?

The best finance leaders don‚Äôt just pace growth.
They shape it with intent.

4. If revenue stalled today, how long could we survive?
‚Üí This is the one most people avoid. But it‚Äôs the one that matters when the market tightens.

‚Üí What if fundraising takes six months longer?
‚Üí What if a big customer churns?
‚Üí What if sales slows but costs don‚Äôt?

Runway isn‚Äôt about panic.
It‚Äôs about control.

It‚Äôs what lets you operate from confidence, not desperation.

You don‚Äôt need 50 dashboards.
You need four questions on repeat.

Ask them.
Answer them.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-06-24,"COGS is a great KPI. But if that‚Äôs the first one you mention, we‚Äôve got a problem.

I heard someone at an accounting conference say it was their top KPI‚Äîno hesitation.

And I‚Äôll be honest: I bristled.

Because COGS isn‚Äôt actionable. It doesn‚Äôt tell you what lever to pull. It just tells you what happened.

But then I stepped back.

COGS **is** a good KPI. Especially in people businesses.
It‚Äôs fundamental. Necessary in indicating performance. Just not‚Ä¶ sufficient.

And maybe the issue isn‚Äôt COGS.
Maybe it‚Äôs me using #KPI as shorthand for something else.

Because in strategic finance, we‚Äôve already moved past KPIs.
We look at drivers. Levers. Actionable metrics.

The stuff you can change or use to change outcomes- your financial KPIs.

Meanwhile, many accounting firms are just now embracing financial KPIs‚Äîand that‚Äôs progress. But they haven‚Äôt yet moved into operational KPIs, let alone the kind of actionable metrics needed to guide performance in real time.

And here‚Äôs the tension: advisory services require exactly that.

You can‚Äôt advise strategically if all your metrics are backward-looking. You can‚Äôt help clients shape outcomes if you‚Äôre only measuring them after the fact.

But many firms are trying to leap from compliance work straight into advisory‚Äîwithout realizing how big the capability gap really is.

That gap isn‚Äôt just about tools. It‚Äôs about mindset, measurement, and the ability to operate in ambiguity.

KPI stands for ‚ÄúKey Performance Indicator.‚Äù
But let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîhalf the time it really means ‚ÄúKinda Passive Insight.‚Äù

So yes‚ÄîCOGS is a good KPI.
But if it‚Äôs the only KPI in the room?

You‚Äôre not doing #Advisory.
You‚Äôre just reporting, with slightly fancier words.

At Gain, when we're working with healthcare providers in the PI space, it's not just about processing claims. It's about a car accident victim getting care without their provider drowning in paperwork. It's about that provider going home feeling accomplished instead of overwhelmed.

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Enhanced visibility: Providers get immediate access to case progress, settlement status, and attorney communications ‚Äî all in one place.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Reduced administrative burden: Automated notifications eliminate hours spent chasing updates or manually tracking cases.

The proposed taxation on litigation funding would dismantle a funding model that enables timely care, predictable cash flow, and sustainable reimbursement for healthcare providers nationwide.

This isn‚Äôt a theoretical impact‚Äîit‚Äôs direct and measurable:

- Providers would face increased bad debt.
- Patients would delay or skip treatment.
- Capital markets would pull back, fast.

Litigation finance exists to make sure injured individuals can access care now, not months or years later. We shouldn‚Äôt be taxing that lifeline out of existence.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-06-18,"The difference between a cash flow model and a decision model
Looks small.

Until you're forced to make a big call.

A cash flow model tells you what‚Äôs happening now.
‚Üí Inflows. Outflows. Burn. Runway.

It helps you manage liquidity.
It gives you a view of risk if nothing changes.

But a decision model is built to test change.
‚Üí Can we afford to open a new market?
‚Üí Should we delay hiring until conversion improves?
‚Üí What happens if churn creeps up two points?

A cash flow model keeps the lights on.
A decision model tells you if it‚Äôs time to build a bigger house.
Or if it‚Äôs time to protect what you already have.

One tracks performance.
The other shapes it.

And that difference matters.
Because most founders and operators stop at tracking.
They build models that show them where they are.
But not what they should do next.

A decision model starts with a real question.
Then it maps the trade-offs.
It forces clarity on assumptions.
It shows the range of outcomes before the money moves.

That‚Äôs what gives finance leverage.
Not just knowing the numbers.
But knowing what‚Äôs likely to happen when they change.

If your model only works for the current plan,
It‚Äôs not a decision tool. It‚Äôs a spreadsheet.

Great finance teams don‚Äôt just measure what happened.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-18,"When I first started working at the intersection of healthcare and financial operations, I underestimated the emotional toll administrative systems can take‚Äîon both patients and providers.

Years ago, I led an initiative to streamline personal injury claim processing for a network of providers. On paper, the system was airtight: efficient intake, precise documentation, faster LOP settlements.

But over time, I noticed a growing frustration on the clinical side. Physicians were spending more time justifying claims than focusing on care. Staff morale was slipping. And worst of all, patients were starting to feel like case files instead of people.

I had optimized the process but lost sight of the experience.

A provider finally said to me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delivering care with one hand tied behind our back.‚Äù That was the turning point.

From that moment forward, I started building with a new lens: operations should serve the mission, not just the metrics.

Today at Gain, our systems do more than manage third-party claims‚Äîthey protect the bandwidth of healthcare professionals so they can focus on what matters most: patient care.

In leadership, we often chase efficiency. But the real question is‚Äîefficient for whom?

If you‚Äôre leading operational change, never forget that the people closest to the process are the ones closest to the pain. And when we design for them, we don‚Äôt just fix workflows.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-06-18,"Everyone wants in on Office of the CFO. But most won‚Äôt make it.
The PE consulting market is shifting ‚Äî fast.

Big 4 and MBB are building dedicated teams focused on strategic finance and the Office of the CFO.

The logic makes sense on paper. PE firms want more specialized, high-impact support. And who better than the Big 4 or MBB? Remember ""nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey""?

But here‚Äôs the issue: this work lives in a weird in-between zone.

It‚Äôs not pure accounting. It‚Äôs not classic strategy. It‚Äôs operator work ‚Äî financial operators, to be specific.

That‚Äôs where most of these firms stumble.

üßÆ Big 4:
They‚Äôve got armies of accountants and controllers. But the mindset that thrives in OCFO work is anti-accounting:
 ‚Üí It's scenario-based, not rules-based
 ‚Üí It rewards flexibility and creativity, not rigid GAAP application
 ‚Üí And ironically, many of the best strategic finance pros don‚Äôt want a Big 4 brand on their resume ‚Äî it actually hurts their positioning if they want to be seen as value creators

üß† MBB:
They‚Äôve got the brains. No doubt. But can they shift from ‚Äústrategist‚Äù to ‚Äúoperator‚Äù? That‚Äôs a much taller order.
 ‚Üí Rolling up sleeves isn't just a metaphor ‚Äî it‚Äôs the job
 ‚Üí And let‚Äôs talk about pricing. OCFO support can‚Äôt command classic strategy rates. Will MBB play ball on that?

Here‚Äôs the part no one likes to admit:
 ‚Üí You can‚Äôt build this with homegrown talent
 ‚Üí You can‚Äôt train your way into credibility in this space
 ‚Üí You have to buy your way in ‚Äî fast. That may mean acquihiring. Paying up for people who‚Äôve done it before, and letting them drive.

And that‚Äôs why firms like Accordion, Riveron, and CrossCountry aren‚Äôt scrambling to break in ‚Äî
 ‚Üí They already hold the high ground
 ‚Üí They‚Äôve built the teams, earned PE trust, and developed muscle memory doing this work across hundreds of portcos
 ‚Üí New entrants aren‚Äôt leading a charge ‚Äî they‚Äôre trying to climb a hill that‚Äôs already been fortified

If your firm is trying to break into OCFO advisory ‚Äî don‚Äôt underestimate how different this work really is.

I‚Äôve helped teams build it. And I‚Äôve seen what happens when they assume it‚Äôs just ‚Äúaccounting, but faster.‚Äù

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-06-11,"The case settled. The check didn‚Äôt arrive. Now the provider is 94 days unpaid‚Äîand counting.

This isn‚Äôt a billing issue.

It‚Äôs a cash flow problem hiding in plain sight across thousands of personal injury cases.

Providers deliver care upfront‚ÄîMRIs, surgery, physical therapy‚Äîbased on trust in the PI process. But too often, settlement timelines stretch far beyond expectation.

‚ùå Settlement delays
‚ùå Unclear lien status
‚ùå Lack of payment transparency

And it‚Äôs not just frustrating‚Äîit‚Äôs financially devastating for clinics with small margins and high fixed costs.

At Gain se, we‚Äôve spent years mapping these financial choke points. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned:

‚úîÔ∏è Transparency in case progress reduces friction at disbursement
‚úîÔ∏è Predictable payment schedules build stronger provider-attorney relationships
‚úîÔ∏è Accelerated funding options help providers avoid write-offs and retain capacity for the next case

There‚Äôs a better way to handle PI reimbursement‚Äîand it starts with designing the system around the realities of medical cash flow.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-10,"When I co-founded American Horizon Financial 14 years ago, I thought signed contracts meant success.

I was wrong.

We'd onboard a multi-specialty practice, celebrate the annual agreement, and pat ourselves on the back. Meanwhile, that same practice would process maybe 20% of their PI cases through our system. 

The rest? Still handled the old way - manually, inefficiently, burning out their staff.

I'd look at our revenue numbers and think we were crushing it... The invoices were getting paid. The renewals were happening. But something felt off.

Then came the wake-up calls. Three practices in one quarter didn't renew. All three had ""looked great on paper"" - paying customers for 18+ months. But when I dug deeper, the truth hit me like a freight train:

They never actually integrated our workflows. They were paying us to sit on the sidelines while they struggled with the same operational chaos that made them call us in the first place.

Here's what I learned: In healthcare operations, contract value means nothing if providers aren't changing their behavior.

Now at Gain, I track what actually matters - not just signed LOPs, but:

‚úÖ Time from case intake to first payment
‚úÖ Staff hours saved on administrative tasks
‚úÖ Attorney relationship touchpoints facilitated

Early-stage chaos looks a lot like scale-up complexity.

But they break for very different reasons.

In the early days, finance is about staying alive.

‚Üí Cash flow updates every week
‚Üí Forecasts built in Google Sheets/Excel
‚Üí Budgets built on instinct, not infrastructure

Founders need fast answers
Even if they‚Äôre 80% right.
Speed matters more than polish.

But once the company starts scaling
Everything shifts.

You‚Äôre still making decisions fast.
But now they impact 10x more people, 10x more capital, and 10x more risk.

The problems get bigger:
‚Üí Metrics get siloed across teams
‚Üí Forecasts stop matching reality
‚Üí Systems strain under headcount growth

The habits that worked at $1M ARR?
They‚Äôre usually what breaks things at $10M.

That‚Äôs where strategic FP&A makes the difference.

I recently reviewed a case file from an imaging center that involved a simple MRI for a personal injury patient.

From initial service to final payment required:

‚úÖ 47 emails between the provider and attorney
‚úÖ 12 phone calls
‚úÖ 4 faxed document packages
‚úÖ 3 different contact people on each side

This level of administrative friction isn't unusual in PI cases‚Äîit's the norm.

The fundamental problem? Medical and legal workflows were not designed to interface efficiently.

Providers who excel in managing third-party liability claims have built operational bridges between these systems:

‚úÖ Clear lines of communication
‚úÖ Designated points of contact
‚úÖ Shared visibility into case progression
‚úÖ Standardized documentation protocols

This isn't about providers becoming legal experts or attorneys becoming medical specialists‚Äîit's about creating aligned operational frameworks that acknowledge the unique nature of the medical-legal interface.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-04,"""The attorney never told us the case was settled 3 months ago.""

I hear this complaint from medical providers constantly, usually followed by frustration about lost revenue and wasted administrative time.

But when I speak with PI attorneys, I hear a different perspective:

""We notified the provider's billing department. It's not our fault if they don't have internal systems to track that information.""

This communication breakdown costs both sides dearly‚Äîdelaying case resolutions, straining professional relationships, and creating unnecessary administrative burden.

The most successful provider-attorney partnerships I've observed have implemented:

‚úÖ Shared visibility systems for case status
‚úÖ Clear communication protocols
‚úÖ Standardized documentation requirements
‚úÖ Defined roles and responsibilities

When medical and legal teams operate with aligned processes, both sides win‚Äîfaster settlements, reduced administrative costs, and better client/patient outcomes.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-06-04,"""We're writing off about 15% of our PI receivables.""

That's what the CFO of a major orthopedic group told me last week.
When I asked how they calculated that figure, he shrugged. ""That's just our best guess.""

After analyzing their data, we discovered the reality was nearly double their estimate.

This isn't unusual.

Most healthcare organizations treating personal injury patients lack the specialized analytics to truly understand their performance.

The data blind spots typically include:

‚úÖ Geographic settlement trends
‚úÖ Settlement success rates by attorney
‚úÖ Average time-to-payment by case type
‚úÖ Write-off patterns across different injury categories

Without these insights, providers are essentially flying blind‚Äîmaking critical business decisions based on gut feeling rather than evidence.

The most successful practices in the PI space have recognized that standard healthcare analytics don't capture the unique dynamics of third-party liability claims.

They've implemented specialized reporting systems that track attorney performance, predict settlement timelines, and identify optimization opportunities throughout the medical-legal process.

The result? Dramatically improved collections and reduced administrative burden.

Medical malpractice claims over 250,000 lives annually. Car accidents leave millions with life-altering injuries. And many corporations consistently prioritize profits over people's wellbeing.

The personal injury ecosystem doesn't exist because attorneys invented it‚Äîit exists because real people need real help after suffering real harm.

For uninsured and underinsured patients, the ability to seek medical care through Letters of Protection isn't a loophole‚Äîit's often their only path to recovery.

The challenge? This system is under constant attack from well-funded interest groups who'd prefer injured individuals settle quickly and cheaply, regardless of what fair compensation might actually look like.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-29,"The conversation medical providers and attorneys need to have, but rarely do.
After 15 years working at the intersection of healthcare and legal services, I've noticed something fascinating:

Providers and attorneys each blame the other for the friction in personal injury cases‚Äîyet rarely communicate directly about improving the process.
The attorneys I speak with express frustration about:

‚úÖ Inconsistent medical documentation
‚úÖ Delayed response to records requests
‚úÖ Last-minute billing surprises
‚úÖ Difficulty coordinating with provider offices

Meanwhile, providers complain about:

‚úÖ Settlement notification delays
‚úÖ Poor communication during case progression
‚úÖ Unclear documentation requirements
‚úÖ Reduction requests without context

The most successful partnerships I've seen have established clear operational frameworks that address both sides' concerns.

This isn't just about better communication‚Äîit's about creating structured systems that align medical and legal workflows.

The result? Faster settlements, reduced administrative burden, and better outcomes for the patients/clients both sides serve.

What operational improvements would strengthen your provider-attorney relationships?

Find the 1.5x CFO.
The strategic, experienced leader who can own the function and build the team.

Then augment them.

Bring in a thought partner who levels them up‚Äînot with slide decks, but with targeted experience that fills the gaps.

For example:
‚Üí You‚Äôve hired a killer CFO.
‚Üí They‚Äôve scaled SaaS companies. 
‚Üí They know systems, strategy, and how to lead.

Instead:
‚Üí Pair them with someone who‚Äôs lived in this space.
‚Üí Who‚Äôs helped accounting firms, consulting firms, and people-based businesses scale.
‚Üí Someone who can accelerate their ramp, pressure-test decisions, and spot pitfalls early.

For too long, we've accepted a system where:

‚úÖ Patients struggle to access care despite legitimate injuries
‚úÖ Providers wait years for reimbursement
‚úÖ Attorneys spend more time managing medical issues than legal ones
‚úÖ Insurance companies delay settlements by design

And everyone loses except the insurance companies.

The solution isn't Band-Aids‚Äîit's reimagining how this entire ecosystem functions.

That starts with technology that creates transparency between providers and attorneys. It continues with structured servicing that replaces manual spreadsheets and missed payments. And it culminates in AI-driven solutions that predict settlement timelines and optimize cash flow.

I founded Gain because I believe injured patients deserve access to quality healthcare, regardless of their insurance status or economic situation.

But delivering on that vision requires more than good intentions‚Äîit demands sophisticated systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-22,"""Our attorneys handle the settlement tracking. We just provide the care.""

This statement from a spine surgeon perfectly captures why so many medical providers struggle with personal injury cases.

It represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the medical-legal interface.
The reality? When providers take a passive role in third-party liability claim management, they experience:

‚úÖ Longer payment cycles (average 8-14 months)
‚úÖ Higher write-off rates (typically 15-30%)
‚úÖ Increased administrative burden chasing updates
‚úÖ Unpredictable cash flow and revenue forecasting

The most successful practices in the PI space take ownership of the entire process by implementing specialized servicing systems‚Äîmaintaining critical visibility without creating administrative nightmares.

These providers aren't trying to do attorneys' jobs. They're implementing operational frameworks that create alignment between medical care and legal processes.

At Gain, our AI-driven platform bridges this gap by automating case tracking, streamlining settlement visibility, and optimizing the entire revenue cycle for personal injury claims.

The result? Shorter payment cycles, lower write-offs, and dramatically improved profitability‚Äîwithout the administrative headache.

This scene from years ago shaped how I think about finance transformation. Too many brilliant FP&A professionals are trapped in what I call ""Scorekeeper Syndrome"" - producing reports nobody reads while executives make decisions without them.
It's not about competence. It's about mindset.
After 20+ years transforming finance functions at Coca-Cola, Expedia, GM, and beyond, I've seen the pattern: teams buried in reconciliations instead of shaping strategy. The breakthrough happens when you shift from ""what happened?"" to ""what should we do about it?""

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-05-21,"Georgia's SB68 just made it dramatically more dangerous for healthcare providers to treat personal injury patients.

By eliminating collateral source protections, this legislation allows insurance companies to argue that providers should only be paid at Medicare or Medicaid rates‚Äîeven for patients who were never on these programs.

Let's be clear about what this means:

When a doctor treats an uninsured accident victim on a Letter of Protection, they're taking significant financial risk. They provide care now, trusting they'll be paid fairly when the case settles‚Äîwhich could take years.

SB68 dramatically increases that risk by allowing insurers to cherry-pick the lowest possible reimbursement rates as ""evidence"" of what's reasonable, regardless of the actual market rate for those services.

The result? 

Many providers will simply stop accepting PI patients altogether.

At Gain, we've built infrastructure specifically designed to help providers navigate this challenging landscape‚Äîwith data-driven approaches, risk management tools, and compliant servicing solutions that protect both providers and patients.

After analyzing hundreds of medical practices' performance in the personal injury space, I've identified a counterintuitive pattern:

The financial success of a PI practice has less to do with case volume or reimbursement rates than with one critical factor: operational design.

I recently compared two imaging centers with nearly identical:

‚úÖ Equipment and technology
‚úÖ Geographic markets
‚úÖ Reimbursement agreements
‚úÖ PI case volume

Yet one was thriving while the other considered abandoning personal injury cases entirely.

The difference? 

Their operational approach to the medical-legal interface. The struggling practice used traditional RCM systems for PI cases. The successful one had implemented specialized servicing solutions designed specifically for third-party liability claims.

In our analysis at Gain, we've observed that practices with specialized PI servicing solutions typically achieve higher collection rates and significantly faster settlement times compared to those using traditional RCM systems for PI cases.

At Gain, we've built our AI-driven platform precisely for this purpose‚Äîto transform how healthcare providers manage the complex PI revenue cycle, bridging the gap between medical care and legal processes.

As CFO, that's not just a wish.¬†
It‚Äôs a financial strategy.

It‚Äôs not about taking less.

It‚Äôs about building something mathematically unstoppable.

Great finance leaders don‚Äôt just manage costs.

They engineer growth engines.

Here‚Äôs what happens when your sales team outearns the CFO:

1. You create a compensation structure that drives the right behaviors.
‚Üí Commission models that reward profitable growth, not just volume.
‚Üí Incentives tied directly to cash flow, not vanity metrics.
‚Üí Performance triggers that balance short-term wins with long-term foundation.

The numbers don‚Äôt lie‚Äîwhen sales makes more, the business makes more.

2. You build financial predictability through sales excellence.
‚Üí A revenue stream you can forecast with confidence.
‚Üí A pipeline you can bank strategic decisions on.
‚Üí A team motivated to bring in the deals that actually matter to the P&L.

3. You demonstrate what finance is really about.
‚Üí While others see CFOs as cost controllers.
‚Üí While competitors treat finance as the ‚Äúno‚Äù department.
‚Üí While other finance leaders obsess over their own compensation.

The best CFOs don‚Äôt need to be the highest earners.

They need to be the best architects of sustainable growth.

They don‚Äôt create finance functions that limit.

They create models that accelerate.

And they know the ultimate measure of financial leadership isn‚Äôt your salary.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-05-19,"Three truths about the personal injury healthcare space that most providers don't want to hear:

1) Your ""higher reimbursement rates"" are mostly a mirage if you're tracking PI cases on spreadsheets. The administrative burden, delayed payments, and inevitable write-offs are consuming those margins.

2) Insurance companies aren't just randomly difficult‚Äîthey're strategically difficult. Their tactics are designed to force settlements by exhausting everyone involved, including medical providers.

3) The practices that thrive in the PI space don't just treat differently‚Äîthey operate differently. They've built systems specifically engineered for the medical-legal interface.

After spending years in this industry, I've watched countless healthcare providers enter the PI space attracted by higher reimbursement rates, only to retreat when the operational complexity overwhelms their standard workflows.

The providers who succeed have embraced specialized technology, third-party servicing partnerships, and medical-legal communication protocols that align with how PI cases actually progress.

The good news? These challenges are solvable. The providers who tackle them aren't just surviving in the PI space‚Äîthey're thriving, with collection rates 25-30% higher than those using traditional RCM approaches.

What's your biggest operational challenge when handling PI claims?

These seven words have killed more financial transformation than any budget cut.

Trapped more CFOs in the past than any legacy system.

And kept finance teams reporting history instead of shaping the future.

Here's what happens when this thinking takes over finance 

‚Üí FP&A becomes backward-looking.

Teams produce the same reports quarter after quarter.

They track lagging indicators instead of leading ones.

They measure what happened instead of influencing what comes next.

‚Üí Finance stays in the back office.
While the business needs financial partners.

While decisions are made without data.

While opportunities slip through the cracks.

‚Üí Manual processes drain all the energy.
Month-end close takes 15 days instead of 5.

Forecasts are 85% accurate when they could be 99%.

Teams waste days building spreadsheets instead of insights.

The most dangerous phrase in finance isn't ""we missed our numbers.""

It's ""we've always closed the books this way.""
Great finance leaders don't preserve processes.

They preserve financial integrity.

They don't protect systems.

They protect business visibility.

And they know that sometimes the most innovative thing a CFO can do is break the finance function before the market breaks the business.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-06,"Three simple questions that revealed hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue leakage in a thriving orthopaedic practice.

Last month, I sat down with the partners of a busy orthopaedic group. On paper, they were crushing it‚Äî27% growth year over year and expanding their PI caseload.

But something wasn't adding up in their finances.
I asked three simple questions:

1.- What does your average case settled for?
2.- Once you factor in bad debt, what does that number drop to?
3.- What is your total average of monthly Billable receivables specific to PI?

You'll be shocked to know how many Doctors or Practice Managers do not have these answers.

After 15 years in this business every doctor makes the same exact mistake, they think because their last case or cases settled at 60% of bill charges that means that's what they are averaging, and they couldn't be more wrong. 

Once you factor in the bad debit it on averages drops their percentages by almost 15-20 % and that's precisely where we step in and can help.

This is just one example of many of a practice that had invested millions in cutting-edge medical technology and clinical training but were using the same administrative processes for PI cases as they did in 2005.

Strategy is often confused with ambition.

True strategy is defined by what you choose not to do.

Strategic finance isn‚Äôt just about funding what‚Äôs possible.

It‚Äôs about surfacing what‚Äôs worth it, given limited capital, time, and talent.

The best CFOs don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to budget requests.

They make tradeoffs visible.

‚úÖ Dedicated case servicing protocols

Not every finance mistake shows up in a report.

Some show up in your margins.

Others in your hiring plans.

And some don‚Äôt show up at all, until it‚Äôs too late.

Here are the ones most teams miss 

‚Üí Mispricing that feels like growth
You‚Äôre winning deals, but losing money.

Discounts stack up. Margins disappear.
And no one‚Äôs checking if the LTV justifies the CAC.

‚Üí Slow decision-making masked as ‚Äúbeing thorough‚Äù
You wait for perfect data.

You hold back on a call.
And while the model looks better next week, the opportunity is already gone.

‚Üí Hiring without financial visibility
You scale headcount before revenue stabilizes.

Cash burn spikes.
Then you cut‚Äîand lose trust in the process.

‚Üí Forecasting on gut, not data
You build the plan to ‚Äúfit the story.‚Äù

But the numbers don‚Äôt hold.
And when reality hits, there‚Äôs no safety net.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-03-24,"How I scaled a finance team without burning out 
(or burning through budget)

Finance teams don‚Äôt fail because they lack talent.

They fail because they scale the wrong way.

Too many companies hire fast, build rigid processes, and overload their teams before they ever become effective.

I‚Äôve built and scaled finance teams across three continents, and here‚Äôs what actually works

1. I automated before I hired.

If a process is slow and manual, adding more people won‚Äôt fix it.

Automation gave my team time to focus on strategy instead of drowning in reports.

2. I outsourced before I built in-house.

Not every finance function needs a full-time hire.

Leveraging outsourced FP&A support kept costs down while maintaining flexibility.

3. I built thinkers, not just processors.

A finance team that only reports numbers is replaceable.

A team that challenges assumptions and drives better decisions is invaluable.

Scaling isn‚Äôt about hiring‚Äîit‚Äôs about building a system that works.

One that grows with the business.

One that doesn‚Äôt burn through budget.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-03-21,"As we continue to update on SB68 here in Georgia, it‚Äôs important to point out that Section 7 of SB68 seeks to modify the Collateral Source Rule, allowing evidence of payments from collateral sources‚Äîsuch as health insurance reimbursements‚Äîto be introduced in personal injury cases.

For context, historically the Collateral Source Rule has prevented defendants from reducing their liability by pointing to compensation plaintiffs may have received from other sources. This rule ensures that plaintiffs are fully compensated for their injuries, regardless of any payments from their insurance or other sources.

Proponents of SB68 argue that these changes will enhance transparency in the legal process. But critics like me are concerned that allowing juries to consider these reimbursements could lead to reduced compensation for plaintiffs. In fact, it might discourage healthcare providers from treating injured patients at all, particularly those who are uninsured or underinsured, thereby limiting access to necessary medical care for vulnerable populations.

It‚Äôs also worth noting again that the proposed legislation includes provisions that could affect the calculation of noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering. Specifically, SB68 seeks to restrict how attorneys can argue for noneconomic damages, undoubtedly leading to less predictable and lower compensation for plaintiffs.

The problem? 
You can‚Äôt cut your way to growth.

Cash flow issues don‚Äôt just happen.¬†
They build up over time. 

And by the time a business feels the squeeze, they‚Äôre already playing defense.

Here‚Äôs what actually works 

1. Speed Up Receivables
‚Üí Shorten payment terms. 

‚Üí Net 60? Make it Net 30. Net 30? Make it Net 15.

‚Üí Offer early payment discounts; better to get 98% of your money today than 100% in 90 days.

‚Üí Automate invoicing and follow-ups, most cash delays happen because businesses don‚Äôt chase payments.

2. Extend Payables
‚Üí Negotiate better supplier terms.

‚Üí Pay vendors strategically; use full payment terms instead of paying early.

‚Üí Consolidate purchases for volume discounts and better deals.

3. Cut Non-Essential Spending
‚Üí Cut expenses that don‚Äôt drive revenue.

‚Üí Pause major purchases that won‚Äôt impact growth in the next six months.

‚Üí Audit subscriptions; most businesses pay for tools they barely use.

4. Build a Rolling Cash Flow Forecast
‚Üí Track cash weekly, not monthly.

‚Üí Identify cash gaps before they become a crisis.

‚Üí Plan for best and worst-case scenarios

5. Protect Essential Functions & Invest in Growth
‚Üí Cutting costs shouldn‚Äôt mean cutting the core functions that keep the business running.

what matters more?

Ask any CFO, and you‚Äôll get different answers.

Some say profitability is the goal. 

Others argue cash flow is king.

The truth? It depends on your business stage and strategy.

When Cash Flow Matters More
‚Üí Early-stage companies: You can‚Äôt scale if you don‚Äôt have the cash to operate.

‚Üí High-growth businesses: Investing in expansion often means running at a short-term loss.

‚Üí Tight liquidity periods: If you can‚Äôt cover payroll or expenses, profitability on paper won‚Äôt help.

When Profitability Matters More
‚Üí Mature businesses: At scale, consistent profitability ensures long-term sustainability.

‚Üí Investor-backed companies nearing an exit: Buyers care about EBITDA and margins.

‚Üí Economic downturns: When financing is harder to secure, profitable companies survive.

The CFO‚Äôs Job: Balancing Both
A profitable business can still fail if it runs out of cash.

A company with strong cash flow but no profitability will struggle long-term.

(And How to Fix It)

Many cash flow forecasts start off with blind spots that make them unreliable.
The question is by how much?

I‚Äôve seen finance teams put together detailed forecasts, only to be blindsided when cash runs tight.
‚Üí Revenue didn‚Äôt hit projections.
‚Üí Customers paid later than expected.
‚Üí Unexpected costs threw everything off.

The issue? Their forecast wasn‚Äôt built for real life.
‚Üí It relied on perfect-world assumptions instead of real data.
‚Üí It ignored timing mismatches between inflows and outflows.
¬†‚ÜíIt wasn‚Äôt updated often enough to reflect business shifts.

A useful cash flow forecast should
‚úÖ Distinguish between committed cash and expected cash to avoid false confidence.
‚úÖ Include multiple scenarios: best case, worst case, and expected case.
‚úÖ Track actual cash movement, not just projected revenue.

If your forecast isn‚Äôt flexible, it‚Äôs just a spreadsheet, not a decision-making tool.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-01-28,"The Secret Art of Direct Cash Flow Forecasting üí°

""Cash is king,"" but when forecasting feels like a guessing game, it‚Äôs more roulette than strategy. Indirect methods often rely on broad assumptions, but direct cash forecasting demands precision‚Äîespecially when every dollar counts.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve used direct cash flow forecasting to guide decisions in $100B corporations, startups, and SMBs. From navigating market volatility to scaling for growth, real-time cash clarity has consistently been the difference-maker.

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to mastering direct cash flow forecasting:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Track Every Dollar: Achieve granular visibility into inflows (sales, collections) and outflows (payroll, rent). This isn‚Äôt just a tactical tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a window into how your business operates.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on the Short Term: While 13-week forecasts are valuable for planning, prioritize actionable insights for the next 4-6 weeks. In challenging times, daily tracking is critical.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Avoid False Precision: A ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù forecast isn‚Äôt always proof of success‚Äîit might be luck. Instead, focus on key accounts and ensure your methodology holds up.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Stress-Test Assumptions: Account for risks like payment delays, unexpected expenses, or market shifts to keep your forecast resilient.

Gain,unknown,2025-01-23,"As a healthcare provider, growing your revenue is an essential part of having a successful medical practice. Fortunately, there are a multitude of ways this can be done. Among the best options are those that quickly expand your patient base to bring in more cash flow, and those that help you grow without becoming overwhelmed. 

There are a lot of accidents and injuries that occur every day, culminating in between 300,000 and 500,000 personal injury claims being filed every year. Plaintiffs in personal injury cases need quality medical providers who will work with them and their attorneys. 

Getting your practice in front of personal injury attorneys is essential to reaching these patients. That‚Äôs where Gain can help. Our platform features your practice on the Gain Provider Map, a trusted resource attorneys use to find providers based on their clients‚Äô location and needs.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-01-21,"From Data to Decisions: Turning Numbers into Insights üìä
""Have you ever walked into a meeting with your CEO or leadership team armed with data, only to watch eyes glaze over before you even get to your key points? Turning numbers into insights is an art‚Äîand a necessity for today‚Äôs CFOs.""

During my time at both Fortune 100 companies and entrepreneurial startups, I‚Äôve learned that numbers are powerful‚Äîbut only when they tell a compelling story. Without that narrative, even the most detailed reports fall flat.

Here‚Äôs how to ensure your data drives decisions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with the 'So What?': Begin with the insights, not the numbers. For example: ""Revenue grew 15%, but customer acquisition costs doubled. Here‚Äôs what it means for us.""

2Ô∏è‚É£ Tell a Story with KPIs: At Expedia, I reengineered FP&A processes to reveal real business drivers, allowing us to tie gross margin trends directly to strategic initiatives.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualize for Impact: Avoid presenting a wall of numbers. Use visualization tools to bring the story to life and ensure your points resonate.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize Scenario Planning: Move beyond static reports. What happens if costs rise or revenue dips? Scenario modeling equips leaders to navigate uncertainty with confidence.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Simplify for Clarity: A concise one-page summary can make all the difference. Reserve details for the Q&A or an appendix for deeper dives when needed.

American for Patient Access (APA): Their purpose is to promote and expand access for uninsured and under-insured patients to immediate medical care and to aid medical providers in offering their services to as many patients as possible, regardless of their payor source.¬†
¬†
Join and donate here: https://lnkd.in/eFMSdg_s ¬†
¬†
The HealthWell Foundation: They help those in need overcome financial barriers to receiving high-quality healthcare. Their grants can assist in covering the costs of prescription copays, surgery, and pediatric care. Since their founding in 2003, they have issued over one million grants worth over $2.7 billion to help an estimated 727,000 patients.¬†¬†
¬†
Donate here: https://lnkd.in/eznT_eWd¬†¬†
¬†
Undue Medical Debt: Medical debt is a crushing burden for millions of Americans, who are often unable to catch up on their unpaid bills on their own. Undue Medical Debt has a transformative impact on patients‚Äô lives by erasing their debt. The charity uses donations to purchase medical debt for pennies on the dollar.¬†¬†
¬†
For more information: https://lnkd.in/ewhCeMn6¬†¬†
¬†
Help Hope Live: The site started out as a foundation established by a transplant surgeon and his wife, who is a nurse, to help end-stage heart disease patients who had been denied insurance pay for transplants. In the 2000s they expanded their mission to include personal injury patients. In 2019, they marked their 35th anniversary, after having raised $135 million.¬†¬†

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2024-11-15,"Healthcare providers are navigating complex financial pressures, where the challenge isn‚Äôt just about salaries‚Äîit‚Äôs about sustainability. As Preston Alexander insightfully points out in his recent post, declining reimbursements impact the very existence of private practices, where overhead costs often outweigh revenue. 

In light of these hurdles, accepting medical liens has become a powerful, alternative, premium reimbursement source.  

By accepting personal injury patients on lien, practices can access new revenue streams that can enhance traditional reimbursements. Patients with Letters of Protection (LOPs) offer providers the opportunity to be compensated from settlement proceeds, often yielding higher payments compared to standard insurance reimbursements. 

At Gain, we streamline this process end-to-end. From underwriting cases, adding your practice to the largest Provider Map in the country, to providing financial solutions when needed, to comprehensive lien management, Gain provides the necessary business intelligence tools to target profitable LOP counterparties and maximize reimbursements. ¬†

The United Arab Emirates‚Äô commitment to advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) was evident throughout the summit.

This mindset resonates with what we aim for at Gain, where we‚Äôre using technology to tackle the complex world of personal injury, making it simpler, faster, and better for everyone involved.¬† 

Another standout moment for me was the discussions on healthcare innovation and emerging AI applications‚Äîboth critical areas for us at Gain, where we innovate to ensure personal injury patients receive the care and support they deserve.

I recently read Tim Ferriss‚Äôs The 4-Hour Workweek‚Äîand while it‚Äôs a bit dated, it still sparked some valuable insights. The core message? We often have far more opportunities to automate, streamline, or outsource our work than we realize.

In finance and leadership, it‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of doing things the ‚Äútraditional way.‚Äù But Ferriss‚Äôs approach challenges us to re-evaluate. What tasks can we delegate? Where can we use automation to free up time? How can we structure our work to focus on impact, not hours?

I‚Äôve started applying some of these principles to my own routine and my team‚Äôs processes. The result? More time for strategic thinking and fewer hours spent on repetitive tasks. It‚Äôs a reminder that being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean being productive.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-08,"""You‚Äôre Only as Good as Your Team: Lessons in Building High-Performing Teams üí™""

One of the most valuable lessons I‚Äôve learned as a leader is that you‚Äôre only as good as the team you build. Creating a high-performing team goes beyond just hiring talented people‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding the right talent and ensuring each person is positioned to leverage their unique strengths.

When I bring new leaders onto my team, I emphasize two key things:

Understand Your Team‚Äôs Strengths: Success doesn‚Äôt come from having a group of high achievers; it comes from having the right people in the right roles. Knowing where each team member excels (and where they may struggle) allows you to maximize impact and create a team that‚Äôs stronger together.

Find Your Leadership Style: I always tell new leaders that what works for me may not work for them. Leadership isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach. The best leaders are those who find their own style‚Äîone that feels authentic to them and empowers their team.

At the end of the day, high performance is built on trust, alignment, and a commitment to playing to each person‚Äôs strengths. If you want to elevate your team, start by investing in each member‚Äôs growth and finding what leadership style drives you.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-05,"No, the Growth Fairy Won‚Äôt Fix Your Financial Forecasts üìä

Tom Fishburne's latest cartoon humorously highlights a common challenge in finance‚Äîrelying on optimism instead of solid strategies. As finance leaders, we‚Äôve all faced the temptation to believe that external market forces will magically turn things around. But this is rarely the case.

In my experience across startups and Fortune 100 companies, meaningful growth comes from internal change, not external hope. It‚Äôs through detailed analysis, operational efficiency, and leveraging real-time forecasting models that we reveal the true business drivers.

Financial planning isn‚Äôt just about predicting the future‚Äîit‚Äôs the opportunity to deeply understand what‚Äôs happening within the company. When done right, it leverages data to spot opportunities, address inefficiencies, and drive transformative growth.

We can‚Äôt clap our hands and hope the Growth Fairy will solve our challenges. Growth is about bold, data-backed decisions and operational discipline. What steps are you taking to ensure sustainable financial growth in your business?

On my way to the Becker's Healthcare Annual ASC Meeting, I sat next to someone wearing a Meta Oculus on the plane and it got me thinking about the power of innovation‚Äîhow technology continues to shape our lives, especially in healthcare. The possibilities are endless! 

This year's Becker's event was phenomenal‚Äîfilled with insightful conversations, valuable takeaways, and some of the best networking opportunities. Hearing from visionary leaders like Nader Samii, Executive Chairman of nimble solutions, and outstanding athlete Caitlin Clark was inspiring. Caitlin‚Äôs dedication and resilience resonate with what it takes to drive healthcare forward. 

Thank you to my friend Scott Becker and his entire team for organizing such an impactful event. From connecting with partners to meeting so many passionate professionals, this experience was unforgettable. 

Similar to the Meta Oculus, the Gain platform utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive growth, helping ASC owners and physicians predict case values and increase reimbursements from Letters of Protection (LOPs). This aligns with our mission to ensure that everyone who has been injured through no fault of their own have access to the quality healthcare they deserve.

On behalf of the Gain team, a big thank you to all the ASC owners and healthcare professionals we met‚Äîand to those we missed, we‚Äôre looking forward to connecting soon. Please reach out for a portal demonstration or to schedule a meeting with me through the link below, I promise to always make time.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-01,"Is Finance Stuck in the Past? üï∞Ô∏è Reflections on Our Love Affair with Excel

I recently attended a panel with FP&A experts, and one question stood out: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the biggest change in finance over the past 30 years?‚Äù

One panelist‚Äôs answer was simple: tools. But just a few moments later, he highlighted the enduring benefits of Excel‚Äîa tool that‚Äôs been around for decades with only minor changes.

This struck me. Here we are in 2023, in a profession that should arguably be at the forefront of technology, yet we‚Äôre still heavily reliant on a tool from the 1980s. As an ‚Äúold timer‚Äù myself, I can‚Äôt deny it: I use Excel constantly. There‚Äôs something about its simplicity and flexibility that feels irreplaceable. But every time I bring up Excel-based solutions, I catch my CTO giving me a look that‚Äôs equal parts pain and exasperation.

It‚Äôs a reminder that while Excel is familiar and reliable, it‚Äôs also holding us back in some ways. In an age of AI, machine learning, and real-time data analytics, we can‚Äôt afford to be stuck in the past. The future of finance demands new tools that are faster, smarter, and more collaborative.

So here‚Äôs my question for all of you: Is it time for finance to finally move beyond Excel, or will it remain our irreplaceable ‚ÄúSwiss Army knife‚Äù for years to come?

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-21,"üìö Great Advice from ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" üí°

I've read ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini multiple times, and it's one of those books that keeps giving each time. One concept that always strikes me is how bosses tend to give more credit to their teams when they're asked to provide advice on a project. ü§î

It makes so much sense‚Äîseeking advice not only strengthens relationships but also encourages a sense of ownership and recognition. I've realized that, subconsciously, I had been using this approach with my managers in the past, and it worked well. Frequently, a few of my team members have also done this with me, which made me acknowledge their work even more.  

Cialdini explains that asking for advice creates a sense of value and involvement, leading to greater commitment and ownership. For bosses, this can boost motivation and engagement‚Äîbut be careful not to overdo it, or it may seem like you're asking them to do your job.

Have you ever experienced the difference that asking for advice can make in a project or relationship? I'd love to hear your thoughts! üó£Ô∏è

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-18,"üìà CPA Pathway Reimagined: A Step Toward Addressing the Accounting Talent Shortage üë®‚Äçüíº

There's been a talent shortage in accounting for a while now, but things are finally starting to shift. Deloitte and KPMG are backing a move away from the traditional 150-credit hour requirement for CPA licensure, opting for a more practical work experience pathway instead. This change could make it easier for people to become CPAs, which is good news for both firms and the public. üëç

However, it's important to acknowledge that many of these firms have contributed to the talent shortage by offering relatively lower starting salaries. Let's face it, accounting doesn't have the same reputation as banking or consulting, compounded by lower salaries and strict requirements, but it's also a path to become a CFO. Many of their employees are the future Controllers and CFOs, and now it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire qualified controllers with public accounting experience. Addressing compensation issues alongside changes to licensure requirements could be key to resolving the talent gap. ü§î

What are your thoughts on experience-based pathways to professional licensure? Could this be the change that attracts the next generation of accounting talent? üë©‚Äçüéì

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-10,"Bridging the Gap Between Finance and AI: CFOs as Innovators ü§ñüí° 
 
As CFOs, embracing AI is no longer optional‚Äîit's essential to understanding how it can transform finance and decision-making. While we don't need to become coders, we must familiarize ourselves with AI's practical applications, like machine learning and natural language processing. This isn't about deep technical expertise but about strategically collaborating with AI to explore new models, test ideas, and make decisions faster. üöÄ 
 
As highlighted in the recent CFO Dive article, ‚ÄúWhat must-have AI skills do finance execs need? First, dig in,‚Äù CFOs need to relate AI directly to their company's goals. W. Michael Hsu noted that AI becomes a sandbox for strategic thinking, helping CFOs quickly analyze data and model scenarios that fit specific business needs. It's about identifying where AI can drive value, such as anomaly detection, compliance automation, or real-time forecasting.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-07,"Managing Global Teams: Strategies for Success üåç 
In today‚Äôs global business environment, leading dispersed teams opens up opportunities for innovation, diversity, and cost efficiencies. From my experience managing teams across continents, I‚Äôve seen how tapping into global talent pools can boost efficiency and creativity while keeping operational costs in check. For example, hiring in regions with lower living expenses allows companies to access top-tier talent at a fraction of the cost compared to high-expense areas like Silicon Valley. 
 
But managing global teams requires a balance of strategy and flexibility. The article Managing Global Teams: Strategies for Success highlights key challenges such as coordinating across time zones, navigating cultural differences, and ensuring compliance with local labor laws. These obstacles can slow decision-making and complicate communication. However, by establishing clear communication channels, adopting flexible work schedules, and fostering an inclusive culture, these challenges can be overcome. 
 
How are you addressing the balance between cost efficiency and operational challenges in your global teams?

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-01,"üî• Urgency vs. Importance: Stop Putting Out Fires and Start Building Your Team üî• 
 
In every new role I‚Äôve taken on, there are always urgent matters demanding immediate attention ‚Äî those fires that seem like they need to be put out right now. But one of the most important priorities that often gets overshadowed by urgency is building a strong team. 
 
üåü The reality is: Building a high-performing team should never be sidelined. While urgent tasks come and go, a well-constructed team is what ensures long-term success and sustainability. 
 
A strong, capable team not only solves today‚Äôs challenges but also drives the company forward in the long run. This team becomes the backbone that helps the company tackle future problems, seize new opportunities, and add real value across all areas ‚Äî especially in finance, where accurate insights and strategic decisions are crucial to growth. 
 
üí° Those extra hours you spend upfront building a strong team will pay off significantly in the long term. The time invested in finding the right people, training them, and fostering collaboration will yield the highest ROI on your time. A well-built team not only helps manage today‚Äôs fires but also becomes the driving force behind tomorrow‚Äôs success. 
 
In all my roles, whether in startups or Fortune 1000 companies, I‚Äôve consistently focused on building teams that combine the best existing talent with new hires. This combination of fresh perspectives and institutional knowledge has allowed me to cultivate teams that don‚Äôt just execute on immediate needs but also elevate the organization‚Äôs capabilities over time. 
 
üî• Remember: Success doesn‚Äôt come from just solving today‚Äôs problems; it‚Äôs about building the team that will take on tomorrow‚Äôs challenges and create lasting value. 
 
How do you prioritize team-building when balancing urgent tasks?

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-09-19,"Having worked in both global Fortune 1000 companies and high-growth startups, I‚Äôve seen firsthand how the hiring process‚Äîand the qualities that lead to success‚Äîcan vary dramatically between these environments. 
 
In larger companies, the structure and established processes are key. Success often depends on one‚Äôs ability to navigate complex organizational hierarchies, work within established frameworks, and drive change in a methodical way. Those who thrive here are often strategic thinkers who excel at managing long-term projects and collaborating across departments. ü§ù 
 
In high-growth companies, the environment is entirely different. Speed, agility, and adaptability are crucial. Success in startups often requires a hands-on, ‚Äúroll-up-your-sleeves‚Äù approach and a tolerance for risk and uncertainty. It‚Äôs less about following established processes and more about building them from scratch. üå±üöÄ 
 
But here‚Äôs where the real magic happens: bringing the strengths of each environment into the other. Those who can transfer the structured, strategic thinking of corporate life into the startup world can help implement processes that allow the company to scale efficiently. üèóÔ∏è On the flip side, injecting the creativity, innovation, and speed of startups into large corporations can break down silos, foster a culture of innovation, and drive rapid transformation. üí° 
 
The key is hiring individuals who not only understand these dynamics but can navigate and bridge both worlds. It‚Äôs not just about choosing one over the other; it‚Äôs about leveraging the best of both to drive growth, regardless of the company size. üéØ

Through these experiences, I‚Äôve learned that while technical skills are crucial, they‚Äôre also the easiest part to assess.

At Gain, we believe in simplifying the management of personal injury cases, providing ASCs with a vital source of reimbursement and ensuring greater access to care for those in need. It's alarming to consider that 100 million Americans, 30 million of whom are uninsured, have less than four weeks of savings. For those injured through no fault of their own, access to quality care becomes a significant challenge. 

Serving personal injury patients on lien not only fulfills a moral obligation but also represents a premium reimbursement source for ASCs. It's a strategy that can help counter the declining reimbursements we're seeing across the board. It's about doing the right thing for personal injury patients and our healthcare system.¬†

2. Behave like you are in a bubble. Stay close with a few people, keep your network small and request collective participation.
