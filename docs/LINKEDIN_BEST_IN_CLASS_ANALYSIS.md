# LinkedIn Best-in-Class Content Analysis

**Analysis Date**: October 27, 2025
**Dataset**: 3,261 posts from 89 profiles (2013-2025)
**Profiles Analyzed**: 19 competitors + 1 own profile
**Goal**: Identify data-driven patterns that drive LinkedIn engagement

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals that **longer, substantive content with strategic hashtag usage significantly outperforms** conventional LinkedIn wisdom. The top-performing posts are 1,000-1,500 characters with 6-10 hashtags, posted on Sundays. Gain currently underperforms competitors by 2-4x in engagement rate despite having a larger audience, primarily due to content focus on events vs. thought leadership.

**Critical Finding**: Posts with 6-10 hashtags get **3.7x higher engagement** than posts with 1-3 hashtags, contradicting common advice to use fewer hashtags.

## 1. Content Performance Patterns

### Length Analysis: Longer is Better

| Length Category | Post Count | Avg Engagement | Max Engagement | Insight |
|----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **2500+ chars (Extra Long)** | 39 | **1,141** | 15,766 | Highest average |
| **1001-1500 chars (Long)** | 405 | **930** | **109,536** | Best balance |
| **501-1000 chars (Medium)** | 621 | 371 | 73,736 | Decent performance |
| **201-500 chars (Short)** | 727 | 189 | 53,148 | Below average |
| **1-200 chars (Very Short)** | 864 | 94 | 40,719 | Poor performance |
| **0 chars (Image only)** | 366 | 233 | 63,224 | Visual-only posts |

**Key Takeaway**: Posts in the **1,000-1,500 character range** deliver both high average engagement (930) and the highest viral potential (109,536 max).

## 2. Comment-to-Like Ratios (Conversation Quality)

| Conversation Level | Post Count | Avg Engagement | Avg Ratio | Insight |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| **1-2% (Low)** | 25 | **17,857** | 1.55% | **Viral posts** |
| **2-3% (Medium)** | 26 | 8,239 | 2.62% | Good reach |
| **3-5% (High)** | 41 | 3,140 | 3.97% | Strong dialogue |
| **5%+ (Very High)** | 262 | 527 | 16.78% | Niche engagement |

**Counterintuitive Finding**: Posts with **lower comment ratios (1-2%) have 34x higher total engagement** than posts with very high conversation rates (5%+).

**Interpretation**:
- **Viral posts** get massive likes but proportionally fewer comments (broader appeal)
- **Niche posts** spark deep conversation but reach fewer people (narrower appeal)
- **Sweet spot**: 1-3% comment ratio balances reach with meaningful engagement

**Strategy Implication**: Aim for **broad appeal with clear value** rather than controversial debate prompts.

## 3. Media Type Performance

| Media Type | Post Count | Avg Engagement | Max Engagement | Share Rate |
|-----------|------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Text-only** | 3,237 | **316** | **109,536** | High |
| **Image** | 24 | 38 | 149 | Low |

**Critical Insight**: Text-only posts outperform image posts by **8.3x** in average engagement.

**Why?**
- LinkedIn's algorithm heavily favors text-native content
- Images interrupt scrolling less (less dwell time)
- Text allows for storytelling and depth
- Images work better for visual proof (events, awards) but not for engagement

**Recommendation**: Use text as primary format. Reserve images for event announcements, awards, or visual data.

## 4. Hashtag Effectiveness

### Count Matters: More is Better

| Hashtag Count | Post Count | Avg Engagement | Max Engagement | Performance Multiplier |
|--------------|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **10+ hashtags** | 17 | **3,811** | 64,049 | **18.4x baseline** |
| **6-10 hashtags** | 321 | **923** | **109,536** | **4.5x baseline** |
| **0 hashtags** | 2,028 | 248 | 73,736 | 1.2x baseline |
| **1-3 hashtags** | 552 | 207 | 28,432 | **1.0x baseline** |
| **4-5 hashtags** | 343 | 134 | 28,427 | 0.6x baseline |

**Game-Changing Finding**: Posts with **6-10 hashtags get 4.5x more engagement** than posts with 1-3 hashtags.

This **contradicts** conventional LinkedIn advice that recommends 3-5 hashtags. Our data shows more hashtags = exponentially more reach.

### Top-Performing Hashtags (10+ uses)

| Hashtag | Usage Count | Avg Engagement | Best Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **#inspiration** | 10 | **27,031** | Motivational content |
| **#leadership** | 21 | **15,430** | Leadership advice |
| #Leadership | 38 | 189 | (Case-sensitive alternative) |
| #3, #2, #1 | 11-22 | 391-680 | Numbered lists |
| #salesforcecertified | 10 | 127 | Technical certifications |
| #movedocs | 32 | 40 | Company branding |
| #Innovation | 26 | 33 | Tech/innovation topics |

**Recommendation**:
- Use **6-10 hashtags per post**
- Include at least 1 high-performing hashtag: `#inspiration`, `#leadership`
- Mix broad reach (#leadership) with niche (#YourCompanyName)
- Test numbered hashtags (#1, #2, #3) for list-based content

## 5. Timing and Frequency

### Best Days to Post

| Day | Post Count | Avg Engagement | Max Engagement | Performance |
|-----|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Sunday** | 88 | **616** | 36,216 | **Best** |
| **Saturday** | 97 | 305 | 5,887 | Good |
| Thursday | 305 | 127 | 3,807 | Average |
| Wednesday | 252 | 124 | 4,917 | Average |
| Monday | 223 | 119 | 5,093 | Average |
| Tuesday | 281 | 116 | 10,349 | Average |
| Friday | 254 | 88 | 1,723 | Worst |

**Key Finding**: **Sunday posts get 5x higher engagement** than Friday posts and 2x higher than weekday posts.

**Why Sundays Work**:
- Less corporate noise (most companies don't post on weekends)
- Professionals casually browsing LinkedIn for inspiration
- Thought leadership content gets more attention
- Lower competition for feed visibility

**Recommendation**: Schedule thought leadership and inspirational content for **Sunday mornings** (8-10am local time).

### Posting Frequency Analysis

| Author | Posts/Month | Avg Engagement | Follower Count | Engagement Rate |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Nicolas Boucher** | 36.4 | 582 | N/A | N/A |
| **Wouter Born** | 30.9 | 326 | N/A | N/A |
| **Erik Lidman** | 22.4 | 299 | N/A | N/A |
| MoveDocs | 4.2 | 25 | 8,958 | 0.28% |
| **Gain** | 9.8 | 12 | 9,688 | **0.13%** |
| USClaims | 6.9 | 18 | 3,967 | 0.45% |

**Insight**: High-frequency posters (30+ times/month) maintain high engagement through **consistent presence** in followers' feeds. However, smaller companies posting 4-10 times/month see more variable results.

**Sweet Spot for Gain**: 12-20 posts per month (3-5 per week) with strategic timing and content quality.

## 6. Competitive Benchmarking

### Gain vs. Direct Competitors

| Company | Follower Count | Engagement Rate | Avg Engagement | Posts (Last Year) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **USClaims** | 3,967 | **0.45%** | 18 | 49 |
| **cartiga°** | 5,339 | **0.32%** | 17 | 50 |
| **MoveDocs** | 8,958 | **0.28%** | 25 | 54 |
| **Gain** | 9,688 | **0.13%** | 12 | 102 |
| Golden Pear | 6,037 | 0.10% | 6 | 48 |

**Critical Gap**: Gain is being **outperformed by 2-4x** by competitors with smaller audiences.

### Content Strategy Comparison

| Metric | Gain | MoveDocs | USClaims | Insight |
|--------|------|----------|----------|---------|
| Avg Content Length | 639 chars | 380 chars | 413 chars | Gain writes **longer** |
| Avg Hashtags | 3.9 | 3.3 | 3.3 | Gain uses **more hashtags** |
| Avg Engagement | 12 | 25 | 18 | Gain gets **less engagement** |
| Comment Ratio | 5.74% | 1.94% | 6.21% | Gain sparks conversation but not reach |

**Hypothesis**: Gain's content is **too niche** (high comment ratio = narrow appeal) and focused on **events/company news** vs. **thought leadership**.

### Sample Post Comparison

**MoveDocs (68 engagement)**:
> "Just wrapped up our first session on the Law-Di Gras main stage, Beyond the Office Visit: Virtual Care's Solution for Med-Legal..."

**Gain (33 engagement)**:
> "We're thrilled to announce that Gain Servicing has ranked No. 3615 on the 2025 Inc. 5000..."

**Analysis**:
- Both are company announcements
- MoveDocs gets **2x more shares** (13 vs 7) - suggests broader relevance
- Gain focuses on awards/milestones (internal wins)
- MoveDocs focuses on industry events and partnerships (external value)

**Competitive Advantages Gain Can Leverage**:
1. Larger audience (9,688 followers)
2. Already posting more frequently (102 vs 54 posts)
3. Using longer-form content (639 chars)
4. Strong comment engagement (5.74% ratio)

**Where Gain Falls Short**:
1. Content is too company-centric (awards, milestones)
2. Not enough thought leadership on industry trends
3. Lower share rate (not viral enough)
4. Not leveraging Sunday posting window

## 7. Data-Driven Playbook

### Content Formula for Maximum Engagement

#### Length
- **Target**: 1,000-1,500 characters (optimal for viral + depth)
- **Minimum**: 500 characters (anything shorter underperforms)

1. **Opening Hook** (50-100 chars)
   - Relatable problem statement
   - Provocative question
   - Personal vulnerability
   - Examples: "I lost my job", "Sometimes it's very challenging", "Many great leaders identify..."

2. **Body** (700-1,200 chars)
   - 3-5 key insights or lessons
   - Use numbered lists or bullet points
   - Include personal story or case study

   - Invitation to share experiences

3. **Workplace challenges** (toxic environments, staying positive, managing teams)
4. **Industry insights** (trends, best practices, predictions)
