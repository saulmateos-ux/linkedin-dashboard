## Executive Summary

Q3 2025 delivered strong performance across multiple metrics. Collections exceeded forecast by 12%, net cash flow outperformed expectations by 18%, and we made significant progress on permanent financing initiatives.

Key highlights:
- **EWB Syndication**: WebBank completed field examination, advancing toward closing
- **Partial Advance Growth**: 570% year-over-year increase in volume
- **New Partnerships**: Michigan market expansion with Dr. Shah network

With seven weeks until our November 17 EWB maturity, we are executing multiple parallel financing solutions and remain confident in securing permanent financing before maturity.

## Sales and Business Development Update

### Michigan Market Expansion

Our relationship with Dr. Shah's Michigan-based healthcare network continued to deepen in Q3. This partnership evolved from a single-facility relationship into a comprehensive revenue cycle management engagement spanning multiple locations.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Total Facilities**: 5 locations across Michigan
- **Monthly Invoice Volume**: 2,400+ invoices
- **Average Invoice Value**: $3,200
- **Expected Annual Revenue**: $450K+ from this network alone

This partnership demonstrates the scalability of our platform for multi-location healthcare providers.

### Product Performance

| Product Type | Q3 2025 Volume | Q3 2024 Volume | YoY Growth |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Pure Servicing | 12,450 | 15,200 | -18.1% |
| Partial Advance | 38,900 | 5,800 | +570.7% |
| Full Purchase | 1,541 | 1,280 | +20.4% |
| **Total** | **52,891** | **22,280** | **+137.4%** |

The significant shift from Pure Servicing to Partial Advance reflects provider preference for upfront capital while maintaining revenue share upside.

## Finance and Capital Markets Update

### EWB Syndication with WebBank

In late September, WebBank conducted a comprehensive field examination of our operations in Atlanta. We hosted in-person meetings with their senior lending team and submitted extensive due diligence packages.

**Progress Timeline**:
- **September 20-22**: Field examination conducted
- **September 25**: Senior leadership presentations
- **October 5**: First round due diligence submitted
- **October 15**: Financial projections finalized

**Next Steps**: Documentation phase targeting early November closing, ahead of our November 17 maturity.

### Financial Performance

| Metric | Q3 Forecast | Q3 Actual | Variance |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Total Collections | $5.2M | $5.8M | +12% |
| Net Cash Flow | $1.1M | $1.3M | +18% |
| Operating Expenses | $980K | $945K | -4% |

Collections beat forecast driven by strong Partial Advance performance. Net cash flow significantly exceeded expectations through both revenue growth and expense discipline.
