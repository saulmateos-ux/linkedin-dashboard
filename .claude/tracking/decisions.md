## ADR-003: Apify for LinkedIn Scraping

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active

### Decision
Use Apify actors (`harvestapi/linkedin-profile-posts`) for LinkedIn data collection.

### Context
LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures. Need a reliable, legal way to collect post data.

### Rationale
- **Managed infrastructure** - Apify handles proxies, rate limiting, captchas
- **Reliable actors** - Community-maintained, tested scrapers
- **Pay-per-use** - Only pay for actual scraping (~$2 per 1k posts)
- **Legal compliance** - Apify handles ToS considerations
- **API access** - Easy integration with Node.js

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Manual scraping (Puppeteer/Playwright)** - Would get blocked quickly
2. **LinkedIn API** - Very limited, no public post data access
3. **Bright Data** - More expensive, overkill for this use case
4. **ScrapingBee** - No LinkedIn-specific actors

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Reliable, won't get blocked
- Managed infrastructure

## ADR-005: Workspace System Architecture

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active

### Decision
Implement workspaces as filters with many-to-many relationships (profiles can belong to multiple workspaces).

### Context
Users need to organize profiles into logical groups (e.g., "Personal", "Competitors", "Gain Company") without duplicating data.

### Rationale
- **No data duplication** - Profiles stored once, referenced many times
- **Flexible organization** - Profile can be in multiple workspaces
- **Filter pattern** - Workspaces filter existing data, don't create new data
- **URL-driven state** - `?workspace=id` in URL for shareable links
- **Join table pattern** - Standard many-to-many database design

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Folders (strict hierarchy)** - Too rigid, profiles can't be in multiple groups
2. **Tags** - Less clear organizational structure
3. **Duplicating profiles** - Wasteful, data inconsistency issues
4. **Single workspace per profile** - Not flexible enough

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Flexible (many-to-many)
- No data duplication
- Standard SQL pattern
- URL-shareable filters
- Clean separation of concerns

❌ **Cons**:
- More complex queries (JOIN operations)
- Need to manage membership table
- Slightly more database calls

## ADR-006: URL Params as State Source of Truth

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active (Supersedes localStorage approach)

### Decision
Use URL query parameters (`?workspace=id`) as the single source of truth for workspace selection, not localStorage.

### Context
Initial implementation used localStorage, causing sync issues between URL and dropdown. Navigation links would lose workspace context.

### Rationale
- **Shareable** - Users can share URLs with workspace filter applied
- **Bookmarkable** - Browser history works correctly
- **No sync issues** - URL is always correct
- **Server-side access** - Server components can read params
- **Standard web pattern** - Expected behavior for filters

### Alternatives Considered
1. **localStorage** - Not shareable, sync issues with URL
2. **React Context only** - Lost on page refresh
3. **Cookies** - Overkill, privacy concerns
4. **Database user preferences** - Too slow, requires auth

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Shareable URLs
- No sync issues
- Server components compatible
- Browser history works
- Clear state management

❌ **Cons**:
- Visible in URL (not a privacy issue here)
- Requires URL param handling in all pages
- Can't have "sticky" default workspace

## ADR-007: TypeScript Strict Mode

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active

### Decision
Enable TypeScript strict mode and eliminate all `any` types from the codebase.

### Context
Initial development used `any` types for rapid prototyping. Led to runtime errors that TypeScript should have caught.

### Rationale
- **Type safety** - Catch errors at build time, not runtime
- **Better IDE support** - Autocomplete, refactoring tools work better
- **Self-documenting** - Types serve as inline documentation
- **Confidence** - Refactoring is safer with proper types
- **Best practice** - Industry standard for TypeScript projects

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep `any` types** - Faster development but more bugs
2. **Gradual typing** - Mixed approach, confusing
3. **Just use JSDoc** - Not as robust as TypeScript

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Fewer runtime errors
- Better refactoring safety
- Self-documenting code
- Better IDE experience
- Easier onboarding

❌ **Cons**:
- Initial time investment to fix types
- Slightly more verbose code
- Learning curve for complex types

### Context
Need a scalable styling solution that works with Next.js Server Components and provides consistent design.

### Rationale
- **Utility-first** - Fast prototyping, consistent spacing
- **No context switching** - Write styles in JSX
- **Tree-shaking** - Unused styles removed automatically
- **Server Component compatible** - No CSS-in-JS issues
- **Responsive design** - Built-in breakpoints

### Alternatives Considered
1. **CSS Modules** - More verbose, harder to maintain
2. **styled-components** - Doesn't work well with Server Components

## ADR-010: Centralized Database Functions (lib/db.ts)

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active

### Decision
All database operations must go through functions in `lib/db.ts`, never raw SQL in components or API routes.

### Context
Need consistent data access patterns, error handling, and type safety across all database operations.

### Rationale
- **Single source of truth** - All queries in one place
- **Reusability** - Functions used by CLI, dashboard, AI assistant
- **Type safety** - TypeScript interfaces for all return types
- **Error handling** - Consistent error patterns
- **Testing** - Easy to mock database layer

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Centralized logic
- Type-safe
- Reusable across CLI and dashboard
- Easy to test
- Consistent error handling

❌ **Cons**:
- All queries must be pre-defined
- Can't do ad-hoc queries easily
- Single file can get large (currently 500+ lines)

## ADR-012: Workspace Batch Scraping

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Active

### Decision
Use Apify's `targetUrls` array parameter to scrape all profiles in a workspace with a single API call, scraping up to 6 profiles in parallel.

### Context
Users wanted to refresh all profiles in a workspace without triggering individual scrape operations.

### Rationale
- **6x faster** - Parallel scraping vs sequential
- **Single API call** - Simpler, less error-prone
- **Same cost** - Apify charges per post, not per actor run
- **Automatic mapping** - Posts mapped to correct profile via `authorProfileUrl`
- **Better UX** - Single progress modal

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Sequential scraping** - 6x slower, worse UX
2. **Client-side parallel calls** - Race conditions, harder to track
3. **Background job queue** - Overkill for this use case

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Much faster (6 profiles in ~30 seconds)
- Single API call
- Same cost as sequential
- Clean progress tracking
- Automatic profile mapping

❌ **Cons**:
- More complex post-processing (mapping posts to profiles)
- All-or-nothing (one failure affects all)
- Harder to debug individual failures

### Rationale
- **Perfect stack alignment** - Built on same technologies we use (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript)
- **Copy-paste philosophy** - No external dependencies, full code ownership
- **150+ animated components** - Extensive library of dashboard-ready components
- **Professional animations** - Purposeful, subtle animations that enhance UX
- **Free and open-source** - MIT license, no ongoing costs
- **Built on shadcn/ui** - Uses same CLI and patterns as shadcn/ui
- **Animation engine (Framer Motion)** - Industry-standard, GPU-accelerated
- **Dashboard-optimized** - Number tickers, animated charts, bento grids

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep current UI** - Functional but looks dated compared to modern SaaS products
2. **Build animations from scratch** - Time-consuming, reinventing the wheel
3. **Use a heavy UI library (MUI, Ant Design)** - Too opinionated, bundle bloat, hard to customize
4. **Headless UI + custom animations** - More work, less cohesive
5. **Framer Motion only** - Would need to build all components ourselves
6. **Tailwind UI** - Not free, limited animated components

### Trade-offs
✅ **Pros**:
- Professional, modern appearance
- 150+ ready-to-use components
- Copy-paste approach (full code ownership)
- No external dependencies (code lives in our repo)
- Perfect for dashboards (number tickers, charts, stats)
- GPU-accelerated animations (60 FPS)
- Accessibility built-in (ARIA compliant)
- Works with Next.js Server Components
- Free and open-source

❌ **Cons**:
- Initial setup time (~30 minutes)
- Need to learn new component API
- Framer Motion adds ~50kb to bundle
- More code in `components/ui/` folder

- Risk of over-animating (requires discipline)

### Implementation Plan
**Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Setup + high-impact components (number-ticker, bento-grid, blur-fade)
**Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Visual polish (sparkles, animated-border, dot-pattern)
**Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Advanced features (animated-beam, shimmer-button)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard looks "SaaS-quality" professional
- [ ] Stat changes animate smoothly (number-ticker)
- [ ] Page transitions feel polished (blur-fade)
- [ ] All animations maintain 60 FPS
- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] No negative performance impact
