meeting in real life like minded people
The AI Finance Club is a real magnet for CFOs and Finance execs who have a huge appetite to learn and are open to the world.

Yesterday I met 10 of the 1,400 members of the AI Finance Club.

They have all an amazing trajectory, worked in several countries, speak several languages, love using technology but are also business oriented.

When I created the AI Finance Club, I didn’t think that the best part about building this would be meeting smart people I could myself also learn from.
So far it has been the best aspect about it!

If you also feel that you have this mindset, but don’t find enough like minded people like you at your job or in your close environment, you can get a taste of the AI Finance Club in my free event next Tuesday 28 October.

Michael Fiddelke rose from finance intern to CEO. 

All at the same company. 
20+ years at Target.
Rotated across:

- Finance
- Strategy
- Operations
- Merchandising

Became CFO, then COO, now CEO.

The AI conversation just changed. Again.

This week, OpenAI dropped its Atlas browser.

And 99% of people are missing the point.

They’re sharing demos of the agent summarizing articles or booking a hotel. These are toys. For years, automation for finance has meant a terrible choice between two flawed models:

Brittle RPA: You pay a Big 4 firm $250k to build a bot that logs into your ERP. It’s a script that mimics mouse clicks. The second your IT team updates a single UI element, the bot shatters, and you’re back to paying for maintenance. It’s automation built on a house of cards.

Black-Box APIs: You pay for a complex integration between NetSuite, Coupa, and Stripe. It’s powerful, but it’s a black box. You have no idea what it’s really doing. When it fails, you don’t know why. You can’t see its work, you can’t fix it, and you’re 100% dependent on developers to maintain it.

Atlas Agent Mode is the start of a new paradigm. Glass-Box Automation.

It’s an AI agent that uses the exact same UI you use.

It sees what you see. It clicks what you click. It reads what you read.

This is a breakthrough for one reason. Trust.

You can finally watch the AI work, in real time, across all your tabs, and take back control at any second.

Stop seeing this as a summarization tool.

The leaders who see it as a UI-based workflow orchestrator will automate their entire department.

(the CFO wants stories, not reports.) 
The SCQA storytelling framework:

1. Situation (S) 

Paint the full picture first. Show where the business stands now - revenue trends, market position, and key metrics. Keep it focused.

Example: ""Our Q1 revenue hit $50M, up 15% YoY, but margins dropped 3 points""

Link operational metrics to financials. If marketing spend jumped 20%, show the conversion rate impact. Numbers without context waste everyone's time.

2. Complication (C) 

Hit the real problem. Don't sugarcoat structural issues. Name the actual business constraints blocking growth.

Example: ""Our fastest-growing product line has the lowest margins, pulling down overall profitability.""

Quantify the impact. If you spot a problem, model out 2-3 scenarios showing exactly how it hurts the bottom line.

3. Question (Q) 

Frame the core decision. What exactly needs to be solved? What trade-offs matter most? Make it specific.

Example: ""Do we push volume growth or optimize pricing to protect margins?""

Always present options, not problems. Your CFO needs clear choices, not open-ended issues.

4. Answer (A) 

Deliver clear actions. What needs to happen? When? Who owns it? Put numbers behind it.

Example: ""Raising prices 5% on low-margin products will boost EBITDA $2M by Q3.""

Build a 30-60-90 day action plan. Show immediate wins, medium-term fixes, and long-term solutions.

- Automate reporting, forecasting & analysis without writing code
- Cut days of manual work down to minutes with AI workflows
- Adopt AI securely with confidence
- Keep on top of the rapid developments in tools and when you should use them

Now let's continue with the kpis,

In boardrooms and investor meetings, the right KPI can make the difference between telling a
compelling growth story and losing trust

Here’s a snapshot:
1. Return on Assets – How efficiently you generate profit from investments
2. Return on Equity – The profitability of shareholders’ capital
3. Current Ratio – Can you meet your short-term obligations?
4. Debt-to-Equity – Balance between leverage and equity financing
5. Earnings per Share (EPS) – Profitability on a per-share basis
6. Net Profit Margin – How much of your revenue remains after costs and taxes
7. Return on Assets (ROA) – Efficiency in turning assets into net income
8. Inventory Turnover – How quickly you sell and replace stock
9. Quick Ratio – Liquidity without relying on inventory
10. Operating Cash Flow Ratio – How well operations cover liabilities

Each KPI comes with its formula + definition so your team can apply them immediately.

This isn’t just a checklist—it’s the CFO playbook for smarter, faster decisions.

Stop reporting. Start driving.

Here's how:

1. Steal the narrative from operations
   
Finance always reacts to what happened. Operations control what happens next. Stop waiting for month-end closes to tell your story. Embed yourself in real-time business decisions.
   
When the sales team debates pricing, you're there with margin impact. When product considers features, you're there with unit economics. When HR plans headcount, you're there with cash flow timing.
   
Be part of the decision, not the aftermath.
   
2. Reverse-engineer the decision
   
Start with what needs to happen, then work backward to justify it. Need budget approval? Don't show costs, show the price of saying no. Need headcount? Don't show growth projections; show the workload that breaks without it.
   
Most finance people present what they calculated. Winners present what executives need to hear to act.
   
Build numbers that answer their question, not yours.
   
3. Master the executive translation
   
CFOs think in cash flow. CEOs think in growth. Board members think in risk. Operations think in efficiency. Same numbers, different stories.
   
Learn to flip your narrative based on your audience. The same margin decline becomes a ‘cash preservation opportunity’ for the CFO and a ‘market share defense strategy’ for the CEO.
   
Stop using one-size-fits-all presentations. Wrong audience, wrong message, wrong outcome.
   
The bottom line:

Stop being the numbers guy.
Start being a profit driver.

Finance that wins:

- Turns data into direction.
- Speaks impact, not accounting.

The kickoff buzz has faded. 
The consultants are buried in models. 
And the CFO is wondering why nothing actually feels different.

Here’s why: 
Most projects are scoped like IT builds — staffed by smart, hard-working people who’ve never sat in a finance seat. They know decks, not dynamics. They interview for two weeks, then vanish into Excel.

Now, it’s worse. 
Much of the work is done offshore, asynchronously — so the people building your model have never even 𝘮𝘦𝘵 your team. The “consultants” sometimes see the deliverable an hour before the call. 

No context. 
No conviction. 
No chance to QA.

The model works (hopefully). 
The business doesn’t.

That’s why I don’t do scoped projects anymore.

On a retained basis, I can: 
⚙️ Diagnose before prescribing — figure out what’s 𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 broken. 
📈 Re-sequence priorities as the real insights emerge. 
🧠 Embed weekly — pressure-test decisions, mentor analysts, build muscle that lasts.

Great creative, great people.

But I’ll admit: I haven’t seen the full list. 
Probably just the ones active on here… 
because that’s where I live too these days.

And yet, the real Office of the CFO is so much bigger than LinkedIn. 
It’s the controller doing reconciliations at 10 p.m. 
The FP&A analyst rebuilding the forecast between board decks. 
The finance ops leader quietly keeping the machine running.

They may never ride a dragon — 
but they keep the kingdom alive. 🏰

So cheers to all the FP&A heroes out there.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7386374467947585536,2025-10-21 12:15:05.36,"FP&A is broken. Most companies want strategic finance partners. Instead, they're getting:

- Excel-bound analysts
- Process-trapped managers
- Backward-looking reporters

3 reasons why this is happening:

1. Wrong focus, wrong results
   
  Traditional FP&A spends time on:
   
  - Forecast updates
  - Budget negotiations
  - Monthly variance reports
   
  What drives business value:
   
  - Growth investment timing
  - Real-time decision support
  - Market opportunity analysis
  - Competitive pricing strategy

2. Broken talent model
   
  Companies still hire for:
   
  - Excel expertise
  - System knowledge
  - Technical accounting
   
  But success requires:
   
  - Decision speed
  - Commercial instinct
  - Business partnership
  - Market understanding

3. Misplaced priorities
   
  FP&A teams measure:
   
  - Report accuracy
  - Forecast precision
  - Process compliance
   
  While businesses need:
   
  - Investment timing
  - Pricing optimization
  - Market share growth
  - Revenue acceleration

Do this:

- KPI: Business growth only
- Learn markets before models
- Connect all analysis to revenue
- Own the business strategy now
- Automate everything that repeats
- Embed directly in sales operations

2025 is the breaking point.

Most of your planning still starts here:

Bank balances: Pulled from online banking portals or CSV exports, usually copied manually into Excel.

Accounts receivable: Exported from your ERP or accounting system (NetSuite, SAP, QuickBooks), showing open invoices and expected payment dates.

Accounts payable: Pulled from the same ERP/AP system. Due invoices, vendor payments, and aging data.

Payroll & recurring expenses: Taken from HRIS tools or past forecasts.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7386050949800275968,2025-10-20 14:49:32.623,"Everyone says private equity is buying law firms. 
That’s not quite right.

PE is investing around law:
→ MSOs that run operations.
→ ABS structures that open limited ownership.
→ litigation-finance vehicles that fund outcomes.

But let’s focus on the MSO. 
That’s where the real shift is happening — the commercialization of firm operations. 

Functions that once sat quietly in the back office are now the platform for scale: 
→ Finance
→ Tech 
→ Data
→ Talent 
These are the new front office. 
That’s the real shift — and it’s bigger than most realize.

Accounting firms went through this first. 
Most assumed they were still running one business — the practice. 

In reality, they were running two: the client-facing firm and the operating company behind it. 

Many missed that because they were too insular — 
too convinced that the people who built the practice were the same people who should run the platform. 

That’s where outside perspective matters.

Law firms are standing at that same crossroads. 
The risk isn’t PE itself — it’s failing to adapt. 
If firms treat outside expertise as intrusion instead of partnership, they’ll repeat the same mistakes accounting firms made in their first PE wave.

Helping firms bring in the right outside perspective isn’t about giving up control — it’s how you free professionals to focus on lawyering while building a scalable business around them.

Curious how to prep your law firm for PE? Let's chat.

I learned Excel by trial and error.

Built hundreds of models.

Broke hundreds more.

Eventually became good enough to teach it to others.

And here's what irritates me most:

The models that look the most sophisticated are usually the worst.

50 tabs.
Color-coded everything.
Formulas that stretch across the entire alphabet.

Beautiful.
Impressive.
Completely f*cked.

You try to trace precedents?
Good luck.

You try to understand the logic?
It's buried under layers of links nobody documented.

Hours later, you finally figure out what it's doing.

And then you find the broken pieces.

→ The circular reference someone ""fixed"" by hardcoding.
→ The hidden tab that was supposed to update but doesn't.
→ The assumption that changed 6 months ago but lives on in cell P47.

Here's what I learned after thousands of models:

The best financial models are boring.

→ One clear logic flow (no treasure hunts)
→ Assumptions visible on page 1 (no mystery inputs)
→ Can explain it on a whiteboard (if you can't, rebuild it)
→ Someone else can audit it in under 30 minutes (the real test)

Complexity isn't sophistication.
It's technical debt waiting to blow up your forecast.

The CFOs I respect most?

They build models a summer intern could follow.

Not because they lack skill.
Because they understand the real risk isn't being wrong.
It's being wrong and not knowing why.

Here’s the reality:

Headcount is not a line item.

Every hire carries salary, benefits, payroll taxes, bonuses, and hidden costs like office space and software. Planning at the individual level matters because averages erase risk.

Roll-ups create illusions.

When everything is lumped into OPEX, you lose visibility into actual drivers. You can’t spot if one team is overloading with high-cost roles, or if salary increases are creeping into margins.

Excel makes this fragile.

One broken formula, one wrong link, and the whole structure collapses. That’s why CFOs spend nights reconciling files instead of steering strategy.

But here’s the shift:

You don’t need to trade detail for control.

With the right FP&A design, you can model every person.
Every salary driver.
Every bonus assumption.

And still roll it all into OPEX with accuracy.

I’m testing a few session ideas that hit on some of the biggest pain points I see across the industry:

💰 Monetizing FP&A Advisory — how to design, price, and scale a client-facing finance offering that actually sells. 

🧾 Fixing Your Firm’s Finance Function — why most firms’ internal finance would flunk their own audit, and how to fix it. 

🤖 AI in the Firm Growth Engine — using AI to power the full client lifecycle, from lead gen to scoping to delivery.

Claude can now do advanced financial modeling in Excel. I built a real 13-week rolling cashflow model in Excel, with formulas, links, and logic. Claude gave me a working file with:

- Linked assumptions and validations.
- Weekly cash balances auto-calculated.
- A chart showing when you run out of money.
- Receivables, payables, payroll, and rent inputs.

All in under 5 minutes, from a single prompt.

I ran it myself.

Claude processed 3 CSVs. 

Built formulas. Flagged errors. And rolled cash week by week.

When I opened Excel, it just worked.

This is the first time AI feels ready for finance.

Sure, ChatGPT can answer questions.

But Claude can build financial systems.

Claude reads and writes Excel like an analyst. It leaves assumptions tabs, variance sheets, and cross-checks. It explains its logic. And you can audit every cell.

TAKEAWAY 

There will be two kinds of companies:

1. Those that use AI institutionally across forecasting, underwriting, and FP&A.

2. Those that lose their best people to the ones that do.

I want you in the first camp.

Claude is showing us the future.

Fast, traceable, transparent finance.

You want to spend less time explaining numbers and more time shaping the decisions behind them.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7384924901427572736,2025-10-17 12:15:01.77,"5 levels of Power BI FP&A must know:

Level 0: Excel exports. Zero automation.
Level 1: Basic DAX. Simple visuals. Still manual work.
Level 2: Advanced DAX. Clean models. Reports that matter.
Level 3: Speed. Security. Smart refresh.
Level 4: Full automation. APIs. Enterprise power.

Quick test:
Manual exports this week?
Can your dashboards forecast?
Does your CEO trust your numbers?

Not there yet?

You're leaving money on the table.

Here's the fix:

1. Master the foundations
   
  Basic DAX isn't enough.
  Star schemas aren't optional.
  Data modeling makes or breaks performance.
   
  Your financial models need rock-solid foundations.
  If you're still writing basic SUM formulas, you're missing out.
   
2. Build for scale
   
  Small datasets forgive bad practices.
  Month-end reporting needs speed.
   
  Incremental refresh isn't luxury.
  It's survival when dealing with years of financial data.
   
3. Automate everything
   
  Manual refreshes waste time.
  Power Automate + Power BI = game changer.
   
  FP&A needs real-time insights.
  Not day-old data from manual exports.
   
4. Security is non-negotiable
   
  RLS protects sensitive financials.
  Different teams need different views.
   
  Finance data needs zero gaps.
  Not ‘everyone has access to everything.’ 
   
Truth is:

Power BI can transform your FP&A function.

What's holding you back isn't the tool.

It's the mindset.

The best FP&A teams aren't asking how to build reports.

They're asking:

How can we automate our entire reporting cycle?

P.S. Power BI excels at reporting, but for financial planning, consider specialized tools like Aimplan. Don't force BI tools to do planning work.",76,12,5,93,15.79,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eriklidman_5-levels-of-power-bi-fpa-must-know-level-activity-7384924901427572736-fpoq

On the surface, it looked like the moment the doomsayers had warned about. 
A Big 6 firm under pressure. Layoffs. 
And Apollo’s name in the debt documents.

For many, it felt like the proof point had finally arrived — 
that private equity had begun to inflict irreversible damage on accounting firms.

Except, the facts don’t hold. It wasn't PE at all.

BDO financed its ESOP with a $1.3B private-credit facility from Apollo. 
Their CEO said Apollo “took no ownership stake and was acting like a bank.” 
Ownership stayed with CPAs and employees. 
No board seats. No management control.

That doesn't make it any less painful. 
People lost jobs. Teams were disrupted. Careers were shaken. 
But this wasn’t PE pulling the strings — it was the consequence of leverage and timing.

And that difference matters. 
If we can’t tell credit from control, 
we’ll keep mistaking every capital experiment for an apocalypse.

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7384591477689204737,2025-10-16 14:10:07.356,"AI won’t replace great CFOs. It will replace the ones who don’t build systems.

Most CFOs talk about AI like it’s a concept.
For me, it’s a workflow.

A few weeks ago, I sat with Nicolas Boucher to walk through how I actually use AI in finance not theory, but daily practice.

Here’s what that looks like 👇

→ Every morning, an AI project preps me before meetings.
It pulls context from my calendar, emails, and notes so I walk into every call knowing what matters most.

→ I run multiple AIs in parallel.
While I’m building models, one is drafting insights.
While I’m in meetings, another is summarizing transcripts.
Work happens while I work.

→ Reporting is fully automated.
AI builds dashboards, flags anomalies, and generates the first draft of commentary, freeing my team to focus on decisions, not decks.

→ For pitch decks, I built a full chain.
Claude for structure.
Deep Research for validation.
GenSpark for polish.
What used to take two days now takes two hours.

But here’s what matters most.
AI isn’t about using tools. It’s about designing systems.
If you stack ten platforms without purpose, you create noise, not leverage.

So I’ve learned a few rules.
→ Orchestrate workflows, not tools.
→ Feed AI consistent context, not perfect data.
→ Build feedback loops for everything you do.

AI won’t replace CFOs.
But it will replace analysts, managers, and leaders who don’t adapt.

The ones who build systems will move faster.
The ones who don’t will get left behind.

Full conversation and real use cases are in the video.

Fast.

For decades, growth only mattered if efficiency improved.
Now, growth itself can be a lever.

Ownership isn’t equal anymore.
Capital has its own kind of leverage.
And who benefits from growth depends on how the firm is financed —
not just how it’s run.

But the fundamentals still matter.
Delegation. Pricing. Margin discipline. Repeatability.
They’re still the engine.

Because in the end, it’s still Margin × Growth.
That equation hasn’t changed — it’s just gained new multipliers.

Professional services used to be driven purely by people.
Now the equation is People × Capital × Technology.

This edition looks at the first new lever — capital —
and how asymmetric ownership is reshaping firm economics.

Next time, we’ll turn to the second: technology —
the new form of leverage redefining what “efficiency” even means.

The AI priority matrix

1.⁠ ⁠High-Value + High-Frequency = Automate FIRST
  Example: Monthly variance commentary, cash flow forecasting

2.⁠ ⁠High-Value + Low-Frequency = Automate SECOND
  Example: Annual budget modeling, M&A financial models

3.⁠ ⁠Low-Value + High-Frequency = Automate THIRD
  Example: Invoice processing, expense approvals

4.⁠ ⁠Low-Value + Low-Frequency = Don't automate (yet)
  Example: One-off reports, ad-hoc analyses

Don't start with low-value tasks.

Don't automate data entry.
Don't automate reconciliations.
Don't automate expense reports. 

Automate the $200/hour work that lives in spreadsheets.

Variance analysis.
Scenario modeling.
Board-ready insights.

TAKEAWAY 

Automate what saves your team's brainpower, not just their time.

Because a finance analyst spending 5 hours on variance analysis is a bigger problem than spending 2 hours on data entry.

Fictional court cases

- Add human oversight
- Document verification

And the truth is — they serve two different brains inside the same team

Here I am deep diving in all the main differences

I created this infographic to help finance leaders and professionals cut through the noise

Because let’s be honest: both tools are powerful, but they shine in different contexts

Here’s the breakdown 👇

Best suited for
1. Copilot → Finance teams using Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and Teams
2. Gemini → Finance professionals working inside Google Sheets, Docs, and Gmail

Core strength
1. Copilot → Automation, accuracy, and integration within Microsoft ecosystem
2. Gemini → Narrative generation, scenario commentary, and creative reasoning

Data & compliance
1. Copilot → Enterprise-grade security under Microsoft Purview, clear audit trail
2.Gemini → Compliant with Google Cloud standards, but lighter on traceability

Financial modeling
1. Copilot → Best for Excel-based modeling, reconciliations, and data cleaning
2. Gemini → Best for explaining forecasts and writing executive summaries

Collaboration
1. Copilot → Natively integrated into Teams, Outlook, and PowerPoint for consistent reporting
2. Gemini → Embedded in Google Meet and Gmail for quick insights and idea drafts

Customization & flexibility
1. Copilot → Works within existing financial structures — fewer surprises
2. Gemini → Freer reasoning and idea generation — but needs human validation

Pricing & access
1. Copilot → Available through Microsoft 365 plans (Enterprise and Business)
2. Gemini → Free and Pro tiers (starting $19.99/month) via Google Workspace

Biggest limitation
1. Copilot → Depends on clean models and structured data
2. Gemini → Can misread numeric logic in complex FP&A cases

So, how should Finance choose?
1. Microsoft-native finance teams → Copilot ensures control and compliance
2. Google-native teams → Gemini enhances narrative and agility
3. Hybrid teams → Use Copilot for data tasks and Gemini for analysis storytelling

Copilot gives you control
Gemini gives you creativity

it’s usually the easiest question I’ll ask.

Until I started advising accounting firms.

→ “We’re prepping for our first audit right now.”

That’s the equivalent of your 𝗖𝗣𝗔 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗪-𝟮 and you saying,

Every board deck wants certainty.

Every forecast pretends to have it.

But here's the truth most people won't say out loud:

No one can predict what's coming.
Not the markets.
Not the customers.
Not even your best model.

I learned that the hard way.

At one company, we had the ""perfect"" capital plan.
Everything lined up demand, margins, cash runway.

Then Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.
Or the IPO market shut down.
Or interest rates doubled.
Or that ""certain"" deal didn't close.

Pick your crisis. They all have the same lesson:

In 72 hours, your perfect plan becomes useless.

That's when I stopped obsessing over precision.
And started focusing on resilience.

Because the CFO's real job isn't to say what will happen 
It's to make sure the company can survive what does.

Preparation beats prediction every time.

You can't control the next downturn,
But you can control your cash discipline.

You can't forecast every customer delay,
But you can model how long you last if revenue slips.

You can't plan for every surprise,
But you can build a balance sheet that absorbs one.

The best CFOs don't sell certainty 
They build systems that bend before they break.

They ask harder questions:

What happens if growth slows 30%?

How long can we sustain this burn?

Which levers buy us time to adjust?

A great forecast gives you a roadmap.
But preparation gives you a parachute.

And when things change and they always do 
It's the parachute that saves the company, not the roadmap.

You don't win by predicting the future.
You win by being ready for it.

You are the CFO of a Fortune 500 company preparing a 3-minute earnings call narrative. You have access to:

• Financials: [upload quarterly P&L, revenue, margin, etc.]

• Strategy docs: [upload board decks, roadmaps, KPIs]

• Market context: [upload analyst notes if available]

Your task: Write a narrative for investors and the board that:

1. Celebrates the wins: Highlight the revenue growth (drivers, new product launches, customer adoption). Frame success as the payoff of prior strategic bets.

2. Acknowledges challenges with transparency: Call out margin pressure or operational headwinds clearly. Explain root causes using uploaded KPI data. Share corrective actions underway.

3. Connects to long-term vision: Tie today’s results into the company’s bigger story of innovation, operational excellence, and strategic transformation. Use uploaded strategy docs.

4. Uses a storytelling device: Apply a metaphor (journey, comeback, turning point) so the message sticks with investors and employees.

5. Delivers with conviction: Close with optimism about the next quarter and confidence in long-term growth.

Instructions for GPT-5:

• Write in plain, confident language.

• Use short sentences and natural cadence (like delivering live).

• Blend data with story: never just present a number, explain what it means.

• Structure like a mini arc: hook, challenge, solution, vision and call to action.

**

Here's what can happen if you don't build your storytelling skills:

1. Your board will stop listening. They’ll tune out numbers they don’t understand.

2. Investors will punish you. They’ll interpret weak quarters as failure instead of part of a larger journey.

3. Your team will disengage. They won’t see how their work ties into strategy, so they’ll walk.

And your competitors who tell better stories will raise more capital, recruit better talent, and command higher valuations, even if their numbers are the same as yours.

Markets don’t reward the best numbers.

They reward the best story about the numbers.

The CFOs and finance operators who master storytelling will be the ones who can dominate. The ones who don’t can be replaced by leaders who can.

The choice is yours:

Be the spreadsheet operator…
Or be the storyteller who makes the market believe.

👉 Let me show some of them live this Thursday: https://vrtc.io/48jirtn

(made free thanks to Vertice sponsoring it)

Imagine you are the CFO and you see this:
SaaS prices up 11%, but 66% of seats sit idle
Renewal was last week

How would you react?

I'm sure you don't want this to happen again.

This is why we need a repeatable way to find shelfware fast


This is what we will discuss this Thursday.

Here are already some examples on how you can use AI:

1. Use GenAI to surface your true KPIs
Ask an AI model with your raw data: “Which 10 KPIs best represent software spend health—and why?” It spots board-level metrics (logins per paid seat, cost per active user, renewal risk cohorts

2. Run cohort analysis in minutes, not days
Segment by department and show 30/60/90-day activity vs. seats and cost; flag cohorts where activity falls below 5%. Finance teams report 2–8 hours; AI does the first pass in ~2 minutes

3. Automate the data mess
Prompt AI to write scripts (Google Apps Script/Office Script/VBA) to combine tabs, standardize vendor names/SSO IDs, and keep only needed columns. No more manual cleanup

4. Ask AI: “What are 100 things I don’t know but should?”
Drop in a billing summary or describe your stack. You’ll uncover blind spots—SSO mismatches, duplicate tools, zombie seats, or teams paying outside procurement

5. Invest in AI-native finance tools
Auto-categorize transactions, flag anomalies, draft entries, and connect ERP/AP/SSO/vendor exports so usage, billing, and renewals flow into one view

6. Pull data via API—with AI as your helper
Have AI draft a Python script to pull last-login and active-seat counts from Okta, Zoom, Atlassian, or M365; then join across apps. Same pattern for Salesforce renewals.

Your team can find and kill shelfware fast by pairing finance judgment with small AI workflows
Cleaner data, stronger negotiations, less waste—without waiting on engineering

For a while, the math worked beautifully: 
Buy firms cheap, consolidate, sell at a higher multiple.

But that window is starting to close.

PE capital is flooding in. 
Strategics are chasing the same deals. 
And valuations — especially in the mid-market — are getting frothy.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁 was about acquiring — buying firms cheap, finding synergies, and capturing multiple expansion.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 is about integrating — actually making those roll-ups 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬.

The hard part isn’t strategy — it’s execution.

That’s where real, durable value will come from next.

Most accounting firms weren’t built for that kind of execution. 
They were built for 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 and compliance — not integration and scale.

Now the market’s shifting. 
Growth depends on 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆, 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀.
It means:
• Turning shared services into true operating leverage
• Using real-time KPIs instead of static reports
• Making finance forward-looking — not backward-reporting
• Expanding into FP&A, strategic finance, and operational advisory
  
That’s how you create value 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 the deal, not just from it.

Most firms can’t make that shift alone. 
It’s not in their DNA — yet.

The next cycle won’t reward the biggest acquirers. 
It’ll reward the ones who 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁.

1. Vague Revenue Projections

Avoid this: ‘Revenue will grow next quarter with expected seasonal boosts.’

Why: CFOs need precise, data-driven forecasts, not fluff.

Replace with specifics:

’Revenue is projected to increase by 12% next quarter, driven by a 15% rise in new customer acquisitions and 10% growth in average deal size.’

2. Lack of Cost Breakdown

Avoid this: ‘Operating expenses were in line with expectations.’

Why: CFOs can’t make strategic decisions without granular cost visibility.

Replace with clarity:

’Operating expenses increased by 7%, mainly due to a 20% rise in R&D investments, and a 5% uptick in marketing costs due to new campaigns.’

3. No Clear Link Between Strategy and Financials

Avoid this: ‘Our EBITDA is up, which indicates growth.’

Why: Financials must connect to business goals. Otherwise, it’s just a number.

Replace with actionable insights:

’EBITDA improved by 8% as a result of cost-saving initiatives in supply chain optimization, which aligns with our strategy to improve operational efficiency.’

4. Overly Optimistic Cash Flow

Avoid this: ‘We expect cash flow to improve, despite recent losses.’

Why: CFOs want realistic, risk-adjusted cash flow insights.

Replace with transparency:

’Cash flow is expected to decline by 5% in the next quarter due to delayed customer payments, with plans to address this by tightening credit terms and accelerating collections.’

5. No Risk Analysis

Avoid this: ‘Everything is running smoothly financially.’

Why: CFOs need to know the risks and uncertainties that could impact the company.

Replace with risk awareness:

’Financial performance is stable, but we are facing potential risks, including regulatory changes in our key markets and increasing raw material costs, which could impact margins by 3-4% in the next 6 months.’

1. They reject speed

A weak team confuses speed with progress. The CEO demands urgency. The CFO questions direction. They ask, is this the right move? What does it cost? What does it risk? They do not celebrate speed. They chase outcomes.

Viable growth > fast growth. Every time.

2. They treat the forecast like a product

Most companies treat forecasts like hope. Strong CEO–CFO pairs treat it like a build. They pressure test inputs. They own misses. They update constantly. No wishful thinking. No hiding bad news. 

Bad news moves faster than good news. No surprises. 

3. They end disagreements with real decisions

Weak teams confuse politeness with alignment. They hold meetings about meetings. They wait for consensus. Strong CEO–CFO pairs debate hard and commit fast. No passive, yes. No silent no. 

They make the call. Own the outcome. Move forward. 

TAKEAWAY

When no one says the hard thing, teams fall apart. 

But great CEO–CFO pairs build on truth, not comfort.

The CEO owns vision. The CFO owns viability.

When both respect the tension... the company stays strong.

AI can handle forecasting and reporting better. 

But it can’t replace judgment, intuition, or relationships. That’s why the next wave of CFOs will go offline. Because in a world run by data, being human becomes your edge.

Here’s what that really means:

1. Connection beats algorithms

Online content creates awareness. But trust... the kind that moves careers, deals, and partnerships still happens face-to-face. When you meet someone in person, you read their tone, their pauses, and their intent. You can’t automate that. 

CFOs who invest in human connection will build faster-moving networks than those relying on feeds and DMs.

2. The human hedge becomes a moat

As automation takes over financial operations, the CFO’s value shifts from accuracy to interpretation. Numbers will always tell what happened. But it takes human context to explain why it matters and what to do next. The best CFOs will be those who combine technical mastery with emotional intelligence, leading teams, investors, and boards through uncertainty.

You can’t learn that through Zoom. You learn it through presence.

3. Signals are stronger offline

Finance runs on nuance tone in a negotiation, energy in a pitch, and confidence in a founder’s eyes. Those signals don’t show up in dashboards. In-person events sharpen your instincts, helping you see risks and opportunities faster. 

AI can predict probabilities. Humans can sense intentions.

4. Rooms create opportunity that screens can’t

Every major inflection point in your career came from a person. The right handshake, the right introduction, the right conversation. Events are no longer about panels. They’re about proximity. You might meet your next investor, co-founder, or client over a 10-minute chat.

And those 10 minutes can move your career.

But the modern finance leaders won’t just attend events.

They’ll host them.

- Roundtables. 
- Small dinners. 
- Private gatherings.

Authority is built in the post-AI world by 3 things:

1. Showing up
2. Sharing ideas
3. Listening deeply

AI may run your systems. But humans still run trust.

And trust, not data, is what drives real business forward.

In 2026, CFOs will win by leaning into humanity.

EBITDA explained to Kids
Explanations for kids... and adults!

💰 What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


❗️ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


💸 How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


👧🏼 Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


🔼 EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don’t take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

You feel it every week.

The WSJ reports AI-native engineers making $260K base vs $180K for traditional devs. That's a 44% premium for changing HOW you think, not WHAT you know.

And it's spreading beyond engineering.

I'm seeing AI-native premiums everywhere:

→ Finance teams who automate reporting
→ Marketing teams who prompt instead of brief
→ Sales ops who build AI-powered workflows
→ HR teams who use AI for analysis, not just screening

The pattern is identical: They ask “What's the real problem, and how can I solve it 10x faster?”

Example: Monthly financial close

Traditional FP&A: 5 days of Excel gymnastics
AI-native FP&A: Python + GPT-4 for variance analysis = 4 hours

Same CPA. Dramatically different value.

The brutal truth: Companies aren't paying for AI certifications. They're paying for people who ship results 5x faster because they see AI as their co-pilot, not their competition.

The premium isn't about your function. It's about whether you're still doing manually what AI could accelerate.

Not the story. The story is why the multiple is lower than other splashy professional services deals—and what that says about the model.

Back-of-envelope: ~$1.3B equity value, take out a meaningful (not all) chunk of year-end cash, divide by FY’24 adj. EBITDA (~$111M) → you’re in the ~7× ballpark. So what’s driving it?

• Search is episodic, not recurring.
• Growth has been mid-single/low-double, not breakout.
• Steady-state margins ~10%-11%, not “advisory premium.”
• Adjacencies (assessment/leadership/interim) haven’t been consistently margin-accretive yet.
• Economics remain rainmaker-concentrated—key-person + macro sensitivity.
• Elite brands avoid staffing-style recurrence to protect price/brand.

Accounting trades richer on recurrence + regulation. OCFO platforms command more on velocity + semi-recurring operating cadence. Search can earn a re-rate—but it’s operational, not narrative: throughput per consultant (without discounting), productized adjacencies with real contribution, and cash-plus-equity plans (MIUs/PIs) that retain seniors.

The hard truth:

- Consolidation is manual and fragile
- Your budget files live on SharePoint graveyards
- Teams lose trust when forecasts constantly break

You know the story:
It works, until it doesn't.

The pattern is clear:
Build in Excel → Share files → Fix errors → Repeat

Let me share a quick story:

A CFO I spoke with had solid reporting in Power BI.

But planning was still in Excel.

One formula mistake could crash consolidation.

His words stuck with me:
It works, but someone's going to break it.

The solution isn't another manual process.
It's better design.

Aimplan brings planning straight into Power BI.

Here's how we break the cycle:

1. One source of truth
   
Budgets, forecasts, and assumptions, all captured inside Power BI.
   
No version chaos. No manual merges.
   
2. Built-in governance
   
Role-based access + audit trails mean every division head updates their numbers.
   
But no one touches what they shouldn't.
   
3. Driver-Based models
   
Headcount, salaries, scenarios, modeled once, scaled everywhere.
   
No fragile formulas.
   
His response?

Simple and clear:

It's like Excel, but more controlled.

Stop relying on processes that eventually break.

Build your planning where your data lives.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7381663428509110272,2025-10-08 12:15:06.031,"Yesterday in London, I took the stage to show CFOs how AI will change their roles and what they must do next: 

CFOs are excited about AI on the surface.

But behind the scenes, they’re unsure.

What if I fall behind?
What if I get it wrong?
What if it replaces jobs?

One thing is clear…

CFOs are ready for change. Hungry to shape what comes next. 

The CFO Office is being rebuilt.

1. Fix what's broken first

Before AI can transform finance, CFOs must modernize their core financial systems. AI amplifies efficiency, but it can’t fix data silos, outdated processes, or broken workflows on its own. Without a solid foundation, AI projects will fail.

2. Get CEO and IT buy-in

AI won’t sell itself. CFOs must build a clear business case that proves AI’s financial impact. Without measurable ROI, AI initiatives won’t get leadership support, and without IT integration, they won’t scale.

3. Bad data = bad AI decisions

AI is only as good as the data it’s fed. If finance data is messy, outdated, or siloed, AI won’t work. CFOs must clean up their data foundation first. No shortcuts. When ERP, FP&A, and reporting tools don’t talk to each other, it leads to data fragmentation. Different teams use different data structures, creating errors and delays. And Lack of controls leads to compliance risks and unreliable AI outputs.

TAKEAWAY

AI needs experimentation.

AI needs rapid iteration and cross-functional collaboration.

AI can’t replace human judgment in critical financial decisions. You must learn how to work with AI, not against it.
 
Every CFO has 2 choices:

1. Act like Blockbuster CFO. 
The new AI project is too risky.

2. Become like the Netflix CFO.
Let’s figure out how AI can impact the bottom line.

The future belongs to CFOs who adapt to change.

P.S. It's possible. CFOs can connect AI to everything: https://lnkd.in/dm-k8y4v",93,19,0,112,20.43,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wouterborn_yesterday-in-london-i-took-the-stage-to-activity-7381663428509110272-zLei
Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7381663411371393024,2025-10-08 12:15:01.945,"5 metrics CFOs want FP&A to urgently report: 

1. Revenue Growth

A slowdown in revenue threatens stability. CFOs need answers now. Are sales slowing? Are customers leaving? Is pricing off? FP&A must go beyond the numbers, find high-value products and customers, adjust pricing, and double down on what’s working.

2. Gross Margin

Lower margins mean lower profits. CFOs want specifics. What’s driving costs up? Materials, labor, pricing pressure? FP&A must track unit costs in real-time and act immediately: renegotiate supplier contracts, cut waste, or adjust pricing before it gets worse.

3. Cash Flow

Running out of cash is a crisis. CFOs need to see it coming. FP&A must monitor cash daily, and flag risks early, not after it’s too late. Tight on cash? Collect payments faster, delay non-essential spending, and renegotiate vendor terms. Keeping the company liquid isn’t an option, it’s survival.

4. Operating Expenses

Rising costs destroy margins. CFOs expect FP&A to spot inefficiencies before they hurt the bottom line. Break down spending by department, scale back what doesn’t fuel growth, and automate where possible. If it doesn’t add value, deprioritize it.

5. ROI Tracking 

If an investment isn’t paying off, it’s a liability. CFOs want clear ROI tracking. Which marketing, hiring, or project spend is working? FP&A must identify what’s driving results, cut what’s failing, and shift funds to where they generate returns.

The bottom line:

When CFOs ask for reports. 

Present them actionable steps.

You are a CFO's partner. Not a reporter. 

FP&A must get 3 things right: 

1. Spot problems early.
2. Make every dollar count.
3. Deliver clear, data-backed solutions.

Which GenAI should you actually use—ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That’s a question I get a lot

This is why I created this guide for you,
Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft’s security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it’s tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails—it works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it’s basic—too much at stake with the world’s number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you’ll never use email the old way!

That changed this week.

Advent International and Corvex are taking Heidrick & Struggles private — a $1.3 billion bet that even the most reputation-driven business in the industry can be platformized.

Search sits in the middle ground — it shares the volatility of OCFO advisory (event-driven, people-led) and the fragmentation of accounting (thousands of boutiques, a few giants).

Until now, that mix kept investors away.

If Advent and Corvex can prove there’s a scalable model across retained, interim, and leadership advisory, this could mark the start of PE’s next frontier in professional services.

🇫🇷 En Français : https://hubs.ly/Q03LkT4g0
(sponsored by Jedox)

Here's how to go from messy data to a dynamic, presentation-ready model in minutes:

1. Automate Your Month-End Close with Scripts
Still copy-pasting from multiple files into spreadsheets?

Try this instead:
Beginner:
Use Google Apps Script to clean & format data in Google Sheets
Ask ChatGPT to write the script

Advanced:
Use Python + script to merge multiple CSVs
Automatically generate a ready-to-use report
Cuts out hours of repetitive work


2. Build Financial Models with AI

All you need is:
Your P&L in CSV
ChatGPT
Prompt example:
“I am a CFO of a manufacturing company.
 I need to prepare a 5 year strategic plan with 3 scenarios:
 1- Base (sales increase by 3% per year, margin constant, cost increase by 2%)
 2- Add a gradual expansion to the US
 3- Pessimistic: -2% in sales volume year after year, margin % decrease by 1% year after year and other cost decrease only 1% year after year
Make this financial model with formulas and make sure i can change the variable with an assumption sheet""

Result:
A structured model with revenue, margin, cost variables
Assumptions tab to tweak inputs
Excel-ready, boardroom-approved


3. Turn Models into Dynamic Slide Decks

In ChatGPT’s Canvas Mode:
 Ask:
“Now build a dynamic slide deck in html to present the different scenarios based on the model you build
 I want to be able to change some assumptions in the slide deck and also have a graph to compare the 3 scenarios (revenue, margin, ebit)”

Why this matters:
You can change assumptions live during meetings
You can compare base vs. pessimistic vs. expansion models
And most importantly: you can show leadership you’re ready for any outcome

CFO: What? Their ROI model looked solid.

Controller: Looked solid because they assumed we have clean, standardized data. We don’t. 15 years of acquisitions = 15 different systems, 15 flavors of revenue recognition, and 15 ways to confuse an algorithm.

CFO: The vendor said their AI ‘handles’ that.

Controller: On paper. In reality? Their reference client spent 14 months and $2.8M just standardizing definitions before the AI could start.

CFO: That’s almost our total project budget.

Controller: And we haven’t even touched compliance yet. Remember the Q2 audit nightmare?

CFO: Unfortunately.

Controller: Their AI would’ve flagged 40% of those transactions as fraud. Because our industry’s patterns don’t match their training data.

CFO: But the savings—

Controller: Are based on full automation. Here’s the real prep cost:

- $1.2M in compliance updates
- $680K for SOX documentation
- $750K for audit control redesign
- $900K for database normalization

CFO: None of that was in the pitch deck.

Controller: It never is. Oh, and our team’s 847 Excel workarounds? That’s 847 potential failure points the AI will happily automate… incorrectly.

Instead, it turns into 𝗸𝗶𝗱-𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵 — school schedules, practices, carpools — chaos.

By the time everyone’s back in rhythm, it’s October.

The plan was to start budgeting mid-September. 
Now no one’s sure who’s running point, and everyone’s acting like there’s still time.

I see this every year in OCFO and accounting firms — smart teams, strong businesses, but a budgeting process that quietly drifts a few weeks late.

It’s not the people — it’s the timing. 
Annual planning was never set up for success.

You send materials in advance — budget templates, reports, your planning calendar (if one exists), and the list of stakeholders involved in budgeting.

I review, then spend one focused day with your leadership team: surfacing blind spots, stress-testing assumptions, and aligning on fixes. 
Within a few days, you get refined findings and clear next steps — fast enough to fold straight into this year’s planning cycle.

I’ve run this with firms that used to still be iterating with their boards in late January — struggling to meet lender covenants that require an approved budget. 
Now they’re getting board sign-off in mid-December — and actually focusing on their families over the holidays, not their budget.

📌 Top-Down Planning

•Starts with the end result in mind
•Sets expectations
•Links with Mission & Strategic Plan
•On the business driver level 
•Considers internal and external factors

Versus

📌  Bottom-Up Planning

•Starts from scratch
•Output is the sum of several sub-plans
•Shows how to execute against given strategy
•On project level
•Evaluates uncertainty to enable contingency planning
•Links with Top-Down Plan

Why should you prepare both, a Top-Down and a Bottom-Up plan?

#1  Compare and de-bias

Top-down plans are likely aggressive-leaning because they are prepared by executives. 

Bottom-up plans tend to be conservative because they are done by business teams that want to exceed expectations. 

Comparing both helps find an unbiased scenario.

#2  Foundation for providing challenge

The difference between the two is a good starting point for challenging the assumptions to estimate the inherent risk.

The moment you waited for is here. 
CFOs can connect AI to everything. 

Just 6 months ago, AI could talk about your business.

But today, it can touch it.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic to give AI agents a simple way to plug into tools, data, and services with no hacks.

Think of it like a USB-C port for AI.

• It can query your ERP.
• It can move your cash.
• Draft your journal entries.
• And soon, it will close your books on its own.

You may not have heard the MCP yet.

But every major player like Microsoft, Genesis Global, Adyen, and Modern Treasury is already deploying it. And if you work in finance or lead a team, it will hit your world faster than any trend since the cloud.

I’m excited to explain to you what MCP really is and how it changes everything for CFOs.

Let’s dive in: https://lnkd.in/dm-k8y4v

Microsoft quietly rolled out Model Context Protocol (MCP) across Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations. And it’s not just another update.

You must know what MCP is and how it works so you can explain it back to your CEO and colleagues. 

I’m working on a couple of examples of MCP servers doing real finance tasks like booking journal entries and retrieving reports from QBO.

Finance is a domain of actions, not just insights.

Emails need sending.
Budgets need updating.
Reports need compiling.
Forecasts need reconciling.

Every finance process, from consolidation to audit prep, has hundreds of small, repetitive steps. Steps that LLMs could understand but not execute.

Until now.

MCP servers act as gateways between the model and the real world.

They let the AI fetch live data, process it, and send instructions to other systems, all with security and context.

So instead of asking:

“What was our Q3 EBITDA?”

You can say:

“Pull Q3 EBITDA from the ERP, compare it with last year, and draft a variance explanation.”

And your AI will:

Connect to your ERP (via an MCP server)
Retrieve the numbers
Analyze the variance
Generate commentary
Store the result in your board deck folder

That’s no longer a chatbot.

That’s a mini CFOP with execution power.

Anthropic built the first open MCP implementation and SDK.

The numbers don’t agree, margin is slipping, and the story isn’t landing

Most teams stop at “what happened.”

But with the 4 types of Analysis, it forces you to go deeper:

1. Descriptive — measure what happened
• Goal: summarize actuals for a board audience
• Prompt starter:
Q3 P&L with MoM/YoY deltas, 5-bullet exec summary, and a revenue vs. cost bar chart
• Use cases: financial statements, KPIs, headcount

2. Diagnostic — explain why it happened
• Goal: isolate drivers
• Prompt starter:
variance bridge (price, volume, mix, cost, FX, one-offs, scrap, overtime) + 3-paragraph commentary and a waterfall
• Tip: flag any driver above ±10% and apply 80/20

3. Predictive — show what could happen next
• Goal: quantify likely futures
• Prompt starter:
use last 12 months by product/pipeline, seasonality, capacity, FX; produce base/low/high with confidence bands
• Sensitivity grid: ±5% price, ±10% volume, ±3% FX; show impact on margin and EBITDA

4. Prescriptive — decide what to do
• Goal: rank actions
• Prompt starter:
list pricing, mix, discounts, SKU, overtime, freight; verify data consistency; return an impact-vs-effort decision matrix
• Board pack: top 5 actions + 120-word summary toward a 35% margin target

4. Ignore every financial projection until the crisis hits.

5. Expect perfect audits but reject compliance funding.

6. Want instant reports but invest in outdated systems.

7. Announce big goals without checking if the cash exists. 

8. Announce acquisitions without looping in finance early.

9. Blame the CFO for market shifts they could not control.

1. You become numb to big numbers. A $50M mistake feels like a rounding error. A $100M decision gets less scrutiny than a $5K expense report. When billions flow through your models, you forget these numbers represent real jobs, real projects, real lives.

2. Your expertise makes you a target. Other departments resent your questions. They hide data, delay responses, create shadow budgets. The more you understand their operations, the harder they work to keep you in the dark. Accuracy becomes a political battle.

3. Your calendar runs in three timelines. You're closing last month's books while adjusting this month's forecast and building next year's budget. Each timeline demands perfection; each mistake compounds across all three. Your mind splits between past, present, and future.

4. You're forced to quantify chaos. Market disruptions, consumer behavior shifts, global events; everyone expects you to put precise numbers on unpredictable forces. Your best guesses become others' guarantees, your ranges become their rigid targets.

5. Success traps you in legacy systems. The more critical your models become, the harder they are to update. The company spends $50M on digital transformation while you run forecasts on decade-old Excel. ‘Too risky to replace’ becomes your eternal curse.

6. Your insights get sanitized. Raw data shows uncomfortable truths about executive decisions, product failures, market mistakes. But your reports must tell acceptable stories. You master the art of hiding harsh realities in neutral language and nested spreadsheet tabs.

7. You face impossible judgment calls daily. Product A's margin looks better, but its data is questionable. Market B shows promise, but the assumptions are shaky. Finance wants conservative numbers, Sales wants aggressive targets. Every model input is a gutsy decision that impacts millions in resources. No amount of experience makes these calls easier.

You can learn accounting reading a book (or taking online courses).
Despite what they tell you in a MBA, you can't learn business judgment in a class room.

The accounting-focused finance team:
→ Knows every journal entry
→ Closes books perfectly on time
→ Builds flawless variance reports
→ Follows every compliance requirement

The business-focused finance team:
→ Knows why gross margins dropped
→ Predicts cash flow issues before they hit
→ Builds models that drive actual decisions
→ Partners with sales on deal structure

Guess which one gets invited to strategy meetings?

The difference shows up everywhere:

Accounting mindset: ""Revenue was $2.1M, up 8% from last month.""
Business mindset: ""We’re growing, but deal sizes are shrinking. Here’s why that matters for Q4.""

Accounting mindset: ""Working capital increased by $300K.""
Business mindset: ""We’re collecting slower and inventory is building. Cash will be tight in 60 days.""

Accounting mindset: ""Gross margin variance was unfavorable by 200 basis points.""
Business mindset: ""Our biggest customer is squeezing prices. We need to diversify or restructure deals.""

The career impact is brutal:

Finance people who only speak accounting stay in finance.
Finance people who speak business become business leaders.

Your technical skills get you hired.
Your business understanding gets you promoted.

1. Faking strategic impact
   
You add strategic to your job title. You call basic math financial modeling. You label every spreadsheet analysis. But you're just counting things in expensive ways. Real strategy changes how money moves. Your strategy is finding new ways to show the same numbers.
   
Stop pretending. Either move money or admit you're just doing math homework. Strategy isn't a word. It's an outcome.
   
2. Chasing stakeholder approval
   
Your analysis changes based on who's in the room. Finance sees one story, Sales another, Operations a third. You're building a reputation as the flexible analyst. Every recommendation comes with a backup plan. Your fear of pushback is stronger than your commitment to accuracy. You're optimizing for peace, not performance.
   
Numbers don't negotiate. Neither should you.
   
3. Staying in pure finance roles
   
The isolated finance analyst role is fading. Cross-functional expertise is the new standard. Modern FP&A requires direct operational involvement. The gap between finance and operations is disappearing. Pure finance careers are becoming automated support functions. You need to build expertise beyond the finance silo.
   
Embed yourself in one operational project for 6 months. Your business acumen matters more than your finance skills.
   
4. Mastering Excel instead of business impact
   
You've mastered every Excel function, but you're optimizing the wrong metrics. While you perfect VLOOKUP formulas, competitors are automating entire forecasting processes. Your complex spreadsheets don't drive decisions. They create information overload. The market needs analysts who generate value, not validate data. Your Excel skills aren't assets. They're distractions from real value creation.

-What drives cash in/out beyond profit
-Which KPIs actually matter
-Small fixes that create breathing room

Essential finance formulas and KPIs

Time value of money shortcuts you can apply instantly

Too many companies suffocate because they don’t manage their Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

The CCC shows how long it takes to turn investments in inventory and other assets into cash from sales

The formula is simple:
CCC = DIO + DSO – DPO

Why it matters:
- Traces the full lifecycle of cash
- Enhances cash flow by optimizing DIO, DSO, or DPO
- Highlights inefficiencies in inventory, receivables, and payables

5 ways to optimize your Cash Conversion Cycle:
1. Implement JIT Inventory – reduce excess stock, improve turnover
2. Negotiate Longer Payment Terms – extend payables without penalties
3. Streamline invoicing – expedite collections, offer early payment discounts
4. Build a strong Cash Culture – involve all departments in optimizing cash
5. Use Advanced Forecasting Tools – predict demand accurately, align inventory

Here's what finance actually does:

CFOs: review decks, prepare board materials.

FP&A: produce models, reports, and scenarios.

Controllers: document, reconcile, and prove accuracy.

This is DOING. 

And this is exactly where AI is strongest.

AI can forecast in seconds.
AI can generate reports instantly.
AI can explain variance analysis automatically.

If you build your identity on Doing, you can be automated out.

So here's what you should be doing:

Ask.
Tell stories.
Build courage.
Rely on your judgment. 

Ask questions that reframe the board debate. 

Build instinct to see which lever matters in a sea of dashboards. Build the courage to say what the numbers imply when no one else will.

This is the new leverage.

And it changes the role of every finance leader:

CFO: from Chief Accountant to Chief Storyteller. You don’t win by owning the books. You win by owning the narrative.

Controller: from guardian of reconciliations to guardian of bots. You don’t prove diligence through hours of manual checks. You prove value by designing systems where bots handle mechanics and humans handle exceptions.

FP&A: from spreadsheet jockey to question master. You don’t grind models faster than AI. You win by asking better questions. AI can’t frame on its own.

NBER research on 'How people use ChatGPT' shows that 40% of all work-related AI use is writing. Why?

Your CEO and the board want you to control the narrative.

AI is being used to write emails, reports, decks, and commentary. 

Not because people can’t write, but because they realize writing is where clarity gets created. For finance, this is the wake-up call:

Numbers without narrative are noise.

And if you can’t tell a story with your numbers, someone else or something else will. 

So it's not about how much you can produce.

It’s how well you can ask.

🌎 Front office — sourcing deals, selling scopes, sitting across from a PE CFO. 
🌍 Back office — closing the books, chasing timesheets, building dashboards no one reads.

I’ve lived in both.

I’ve sourced and sold $500k engagements to the 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗘 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗺𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱. 
I’ve built BI models that became the backbone of $200M+ growth stories. 
I’ve sat across the table from CFOs, boards, and sponsors — and closed.

And I’ve also been on the other side, deep in the trenches: 
→ Writing automations to ping late timesheet offenders 
→ Building reporting packages from scratch 
→ Forecasting headcount and utilization week by week

Here’s the kicker: the BD and execution leads I nagged internally let me do it… because they’d already seen me deliver in their universe.

That credibility — that ability to pierce the veil between front and back office — is the glue most firms don’t have.

And when you don’t?
• Engagement Letters go out with baked-in margin risk
• Delivery runs without profitability guardrails
• Finance becomes a scorekeeper instead of a growth driver

My finance function assessments are designed to fix this. 
Because I don’t just “review finance,"" and give you the tablestakes:
• Recommend shorter close timelines
• Tell you what ""best-in-class"" AR days outstanding looks like
• Give you a KPI dump (utilization, realization, revenue per FTE, etc...) 

I also rewire finance's role across the entire deal cycle.
• Pursuit teams armed with the knowledge to confidently scope engagements based on what's worked
• AR teams armed to promptly invoice: both to improve collection timing and to avoid clients receiving unexpectedly large bills
• FP&A teams armed with live data to flag margin compression and write-off risk before the Engagement Letter even goes out

For much, much less than six figures.

Can your finance function deliver on all that? If not, you're losing out on opportunities before the deal even starts.

Most people think the CFO’s job is to manage money.
Cash. Budgets. Forecasts. Reporting.

But the best CFOs do something bigger.
They design how the company absorbs and responds to risk.

Because risk isn’t a single event.
It’s constant.
Revenue concentration.
Market downturns.
Delayed fundraising.
Regulatory changes.
Even a single bad hire.

And here’s the truth:
Most finance teams only react when risk shows up.
By then, it’s too late.

The companies that endure are built differently.
They don’t just plan for growth.
They plan for turbulence.

That’s what risk architecture looks like.

→ Scenario planning that doesn’t just model upside, but survival.
What happens if revenue drops 20%? What if fundraising takes 6 months longer?

→ Systems that protect cash before it’s needed.
Contracts structured for flexibility. Vendor terms that buy time. Reserves that buy options.

→ Spend that’s tied to milestones, not just bank balance.
Because hiring 20 people before the model proves out isn’t strategy it’s hope.

→ Communication loops that make risk visible early.
Dashboards that surface weak signals. Narratives that show the trade-offs clearly to the board.

When it works, the company doesn’t just survive shocks.
It absorbs them.
It adapts.
It moves faster than competitors who are still scrambling for answers.

That’s what great CFOs actually do.
Not just stewards of money.
Architects of resilience.

Because in the end, capital is finite.
But risk never runs out.

Before AI can transform finance, CFOs must modernize their core financial systems. AI amplifies efficiency, but it can’t fix:

- Data silos
- Broken workflows
- Outdated processes

Without a solid foundation, AI projects will fail.

Start with the basics:

Many finance teams still rely on legacy ERPs, scattered Excel models, and disconnected systems. This leads to:

1. Slow, manual financial close
AI can cut processing time in half.

2. Outdated forecasts
AI adjusts predictions instantly based on live data.

3. Compliance risks
AI spots anomalies before they become fraud.

AI can’t function without structured, real-time data. 

Before implementing AI, CFOs must:

a) Break down data silos. Unify financial data across ERPs, FP&A, and reporting systems.

b) Invest in a modern finance tech stack. Move beyond legacy systems to cloud-based platforms.

c) Automate core financial processes. Standardize workflows to reduce errors and improve speed.

CFOs who invest in fixing the fundamentals will see faster, more reliable AI adoption without wasted investments in tools that can’t function in a broken system.

The Pareto Rule applies here:

80% of inefficiencies come from 20% of finance processes.

So, back to you.

Every CFO has 2 choices:

1. Act like Blockbuster CFO. 
The new AI project is too expensive right now.

2. Become like the Netflix CFO.
Let’s find out how AI can accelerate profitability.

1. Your forecasts are just last year plus 10%

You rely on simple tweaks, not real analysis. Growth means digging deeper and understanding why numbers change, not guessing.

2. You wait for data to come to you

You sit back and react instead of hunting for insights. Top analysts actively seek missing info and connect the dots early.

3. You ignore automation and tools

Manually crunching numbers because 'that's how it's always been done' limits your impact. Jump into tech to work smarter, not harder.

4. You chase busywork, not breakthroughs

Filling dashboards or running endless ‘ad hoc’ reports won’t get you noticed. Growth means asking, ‘What problem am I solving?’

5. You let politics silence your analysis

If you filter findings to keep others happy, you’re choosing comfort over impact. Real FP&A pushes boundaries when it counts.

6. You treat every task like a formality, not a chance to lead

Doing what’s asked without thinking beyond the rules won’t get you anywhere. Real FP&A creates value by challenging the script.

7. You rely on luck instead of building skills

Hoping things will improve because 'next time will be better' won’t cut it. Growth is relentless learning and brutal self-honesty.

Realize you're in your comfort zone.

Accountants and consultants? We get the Monday Mandatories.

Early in my career, if my timesheet was late three weeks in a year, my bonus got docked. I still had that pit in my stomach two years later — even after I’d left the role.

Later, I ran the analytics on $200M of billable hours a year. My email address was the one that pinged 1,000+ people if they were even a day late submitting. (Automated, of course — but it didn’t matter. I was that guy in their inbox.)

And here’s the bigger issue: hours aren’t just painful — they’re often mismanaged.

• Leaders inflate hours to hit budget
• Managers suppress hours to cover bad scoping

Everyone in professional services has seen these games. And none of them measure what actually matters. Hours measure cost. They don’t measure value.

Now, with private equity demanding scale and AI automating the grunt work that filled timesheets, the shift away from hours isn’t optional. It’s inevitable. Firms that cling to hourly billing will be left behind.

That’s why I blew up timesheets in my own firm.

Today, when I work with clients — accounting firms, consulting firms, and PE-backed finance orgs — I don’t sell hours. I price for outcomes. Because the goal isn’t to clock time, it’s to create leverage:

• Finance functions that run without firefighting
• Scalable advisory offerings that actually sell
• PE-ready reporting and KPI frameworks that hold up in diligence

👉 If you’re a PE sponsor, or an accounting/consulting leader building or scaling OCFO/FP&A advisory services, DM me or book time via the link in my profile.

Here I am deep diving in all the main differences:

I created this infographic to help finance leaders and professionals cut through the noise

Because let’s be honest: both tools are powerful, but they shine in different contexts

Here’s the breakdown 👇

Best suited for
1. ChatGPT → Individuals & small businesses wanting the best UI and latest features
2. Gemini → Google Workspace users who live in Docs, Sheets, Gmail

Featured models
1. ChatGPT → GPT-5 (deep reasoning), GPT-4o (fast, flexible)
2. Gemini → 2.5 Pro (most powerful), 2.5 Flash (best price-performance), 2.5 Flash-Lite (low-latency)

Customized assistants & agents
1. ChatGPT → Custom GPTs + ChatGPT Agent (Pro only)
2. Gemini → “Gems” (Pro/Ultra only), integrated in Google apps

What’s free?
1. ChatGPT → Limited GPT-5/5-Mini, 3 file uploads/day, only pre-made GPTs
2. Gemini → Limited 2.5 Pro access, 10 file uploads/month, can create basic Gems

Paid plans
1. ChatGPT Plus ($20) → GPT-5 access, custom GPTs, file uploads, deep research
2. ChatGPT Pro ($200) → Expanded limits, GPT-5 Pro
3. Gemini Pro ($19.99) → NotebookLM, Deep Research, AI credits
4. Gemini Ultra ($249.99) → 12,500 credits/month, NotebookLM, Deep Research
5. Business & enterprise tiers → advanced admin/security for both

Data security
1. Both comply with SOC2, ISO standards, GDPR, CCPA
2. Enterprises get stronger data isolation

So, how do you choose?
1. If your workflows run on Microsoft or standalone apps → ChatGPT fits better
2. If your world is Google Docs, Gmail, Sheets → Gemini is more native

At the end of the day: Both can change the way finance teams work

The Monthly Performance Review

It's where you present the numbers, how the company did in the last period, and crucially:

What you recommend leaders should do about it. 

That's what differentiates average from great FP&A professionals. 

Average ones simply report about the variance and a shallow explanation of why it occurred.

But great FP&A leaders dig into the operational metrics and collaborate with their cross-functional business partners...

To make concrete recommendations about how the company can mitigate a risk or capitalize on an opportunity.

This one-pager explains how the Performance Review should be structured, based on what I learned from my mentors at Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Squarespace.

Today, it’s one of the fastest-growing corners of professional services — attracting PE capital, spawning challengers like ValueBridge Partners, and reshaping how finance creates value.

But this market wasn’t born in a boardroom.
It was born in crisis.
And it’s been defined by five eras since:

⚡From “bankers for hire” after the GFC
→ To PE becoming the natural client
→ To expansion into ops/accounting/tech
→ To PE investors backing the advisors themselves
→ To the pandemic’s two phases: crisis → hypergrowth → the music stops

7 months ago, AI CFO Office started as a newsletter.

Last night, it became a room full of CFOs and finance leaders sharing:

• Raw stories
• AI strategies 
• Challenging ideas
• Having dinner together
• Building friendships that go beyond finance

CFOs pulled me aside and asked, “Where do I start?”

My answer was simple.

The first step is to fix what’s broken. I pointed them to my newsletter with 7 steps, because transformation starts with a clear path: https://lnkd.in/d7AxNKnP

There are 2 types of CFOs.

Blockbuster CFOs who manage what already exists.
Netflix CFOs who reimagine the whole model.

Don’t be the Blockbuster CFO.

The night was full of energy.

New friendships sparked over conversations about AI, finance, and life.

Honest panels (Paulo Tabarelli Batista & Mohamed Rifai Vally (MBA)) sharing hot takes on how they’re using AI (I’ll share highlights in tomorrow’s newsletter).

CFOs who admitted they’re still stuck in traditional tech stacks  but saw demos of real AI tools (finstory.ai, Dost, and Pluto) and realized they can start somewhere.

CFOs shared the hard truth.
The traditional EPM stack is ending.

AI is being introduced. 

The CFO Office is being rebuilt.

And here’s the part that mattered most.

People stayed. All 4 hours.

They joined from all over the world just to be at this event. 

the U.S., Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey and all parts of the UAE & Asia.

That's wild. 

And nobody wanted to leave. 

This was more than an event.

It was proof that CFOs are ready for change.

And hungry to shape what comes next.

Thank you all for the best CFO Office event.

Ratios aren’t for auditors—they’re for operators. 

Used well, they turn a messy P&L and balance sheet into a map: where cash is tight, where capital is over-levered, where assets aren’t pulling their weight.

Here’s a 1-pager of Financial Ratios FP&A needs to know (see image). 

It groups the essentials and shows formulas at a glance:

• Liquidity → Can we meet near-term obligations? (Current, Quick, Cash ratio)
  
• Leverage → Are we funding growth wisely? (Debt, D/E, Interest coverage)
  
• Efficiency → Are assets working? (Inventory/AP/AR turns, Asset & Fixed-asset turnover)
  
• Profitability → Are margins improving? (Gross, Operating, Net, ROA/ROE)
  
• Market value → What’s the market telling us? (Dividend yield, Earnings yield)
  
How to use it this quarter:

1. Pick a business question (e.g., “Why is cash tightening?”).
   
2. Choose 3–5 ratios per question—no more.
   
3. Set guardrails/targets and review cadence.
   
4. Tie movements to actions (price, mix, terms, capacity, capex).
   
Save the one-pager for your next review—and tell me which three ratios you’ll track weekly.

It’s communication.

I didn’t believe this early in my career.
I thought the best finance leaders were the ones who built the tightest models, mastered the accounting rules, or could slice data faster than anyone else.

But the longer I’ve been in the seat, the clearer it’s become:
The numbers only matter if people understand what they mean.

A forecast is useless if operators can’t see how it connects to their world.
A board deck is noise if investors can’t see the story behind the metrics.
Even cash flow, the lifeline of every company, loses impact if leadership doesn’t understand what’s at risk.

Finance leaders don’t get paid to produce spreadsheets.
They get paid to drive decisions.
And decisions are shaped by clarity, not complexity.

I’ve seen CFOs lose the room because they buried people in variance tables.
And I’ve seen CFOs win the room with a single slide that framed risk, reward, and trade-offs in plain English.

The difference wasn’t the math.
It was the communication.

Numbers don’t move people.
Stories about numbers do.

And that’s why communication is the most underrated and most important skill in finance leadership.

It wasn’t born in accounting.
It wasn’t born in consulting.

It came out of the 2008 financial crisis.
Bankers suddenly out of work carried their skills into a new lane:
• Deal-grade modeling
• Transactional judgment
• Speed under pressure

➡️ A new model: PE-focused OCFO advisory.

From there, the market unfolded in distinct phases:
1️⃣ Founding & GFC Shock (2006–10): The crisis displaced #InvestmentBankers, creating the seed of a new industry (Riveron, Accordion and others).
2️⃣ Early Alignment with PE (2010–15): Firms positioned themselves as the natural partner to sponsors (CrossCountry Consulting and others).
3️⃣ New Entrants & Scaling (2016–19): A wave of boutiques formed, and the market began to professionalize (E78, Virtas Partners and others).
4️⃣ Pandemic Surge (2020–22): Demand spiked as sponsors needed faster, deeper insight into portfolio performance.
5️⃣ Operational #ValueCreation (2023–today): With PE now backing most of the leading firms, focus has shifted toward operational value creation and long-term impact.

The twist: #PE isn’t just the client anymore. It’s the owner.

This chart shows how the #OCFO market has taken shape across those five eras — and how capital has fueled its evolution.

Some adults still nod at EBITDA... without fully getting it 

Let’s fix that — with lemonade 

Explanation for kids... and adults!

💰 What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


❗️ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


💸 How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


👧🏼 Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


🔼 EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don’t take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

—

But that’s just the start…

Modern CFOs don’t just know EBITDA — they use AI for:

- Financial Analysis 
- Automation
- Road map creation

Nicolas Boucher,bouchernicolas,partner,7376648709163610112,2025-09-24 16:08:23.77,"Just finished a training session for a finance team on how to use AI for Finance

Here’s what we covered:

First I asked them how they were using AI

Most of them were only using AI for emails, research, and a little help with formulas

Not one was really leveraging AI on the core Finance tasks:
- Financial Analysis
- Reporting
- Automation

So I spent 2 hours walking them through exactly these 3 areas

Let me share with you what I taught them:

First part: Financial Analysis
I started asking them which model is best for financial analysis?

Only a few people knew this, but the best ones are: ChatGPT 5 in Thinking Mode, Copilot Analyzer Agent, and for Gemini the 2.5 Pro model.

Then I showed them the biggest mistake to avoid:
I see too many people just asking AI to “analyze your file” with no instructions
Instead, I gave them my 5-step framework:
1) Check consistency of data (my old auditor reflex).
2) Ask AI which analyses to perform: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive. (This forces it to be ambitious)
3) Run the actual calculations and show the work
4) Prepare visuals/graphs
5) Write commentary like a seasoned CFO
Try this and you will see much better results!!


Second part: Reporting
Here’s the trick almost nobody knows: the Canvas function in ChatGPT & Gemini. (Not Canva, the design tool. I mean Canvas, hidden under the tools icon in your chat box)

With Canvas, you can build dynamic slides and models
Example: a sensitivity analysis that instantly updates as you tweak assumptions

This is the part that usually gets jaws to drop.

Here’s why it’s a game-changer:
You type what you want, and it literally codes a dynamic reporting for you
It's like combining a deck of slides + a BI dashboard
All done in a few minutes

You can tweak assumptions in real-time and the slides update instantly

So instead of walking into a meeting with a static Excel full of tables…
You show up with an interactive model that answers “what if” questions on the spot
Cool right?


Third part: Automation
This part really excited them (because of the time saving opportunities!)

But most finance folks mix up AI and automation
They’re not the same:
Automation = stable, repeatable process (like an Excel formula or an Outlook rule)
AI = flexible, adaptive responses (but also always changing!)

Finance needs automation first, not AI

But the main problem: most finance people can’t code

But now AI writes the scripts for you
I demoed them how to:
- Consolidate multiple files into one automatically
- Clean and format data in seconds

All with scripts they can keep reusing. No AI needed after ;)


Finally I wrapped up with my best tip: how to create CustomGPTs / Copilot Agents using a framework I only share with clients and my AI Finance Club.


You might want to learn this for yourself as well.
So, this Friday, you should join my free masterclass. I’ll be showing these use cases.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7376589998159982592,2025-09-24 12:15:05.976,"The CFO Tech Stack is broken.
Here are 3 reasons why:

1. The stack frustrates modern CFOs

The stack was designed for control, not speed.

It’s a mix of legacy ERPs, disconnected billing systems, and dashboards that rely on manual updates.

CFOs have outgrown it but they're still stuck in it.

Modern CFOs want:

- Real-time insights.
- AI to do the manual work.
- Finance to be part of the growth.

The old tools don’t match the new expectations.

2. The stack can’t support the AI shift

Finance teams want to use AI for forecasting, risk analysis, and planning.

But most systems weren’t built for it. 

Data is fragmented, and workflows are static.

That’s why fewer than 1 in 5 CFOs say they’re ready to use AI effectively, even though nearly half plan to invest.

You can’t run AI on spreadsheets and siloed systems.

You need infrastructure that thinks ahead, not just tracks the past.

3. CFOs don't want to become the back office again

Modern CFOs are managing revenue ops, scenario planning, and tech adoption, not just accounting. But they’re still stuck reconciling reports and validating data across disconnected platforms.

The tools aren’t the problem. The architecture is.

Agentic systems, powered by AI and built around a central finance data layer, can let CFOs automate what slows them down and focus on what moves the business.

TAKEAWAY

The best CFOs are rebuilding the foundation with AI at the center.

If your stack was built for compliance, it can't drive growth.

The WSJ just ran a piece on Wall Street’s hiring spree — JPMorgan alone added 100+ MDs this year as M&A and IPO markets heat up. Other top banks are doing the same. Talent is the story. But so is cyclicality.

What does it mean for Office of the CFO advisory?

🔹 Talent wars are real
Bankers get poached for their relationships, deal reps, and boardroom access. OCFO firms face the same fight. The best advisors bring not just modeling and reporting skills, but trust with sponsors and operators. That’s scarce, and it’s where firms differentiate.

🔹 Cycle neutrality has limits
Compared to pure IB, OCFO is steadier. FP&A, tech enablement, and recurring finance-ops provide ballast. But let’s not pretend it’s immune — when PE deals surge, demand spikes; when activity cools, budgets tighten. We’re not zero-beta.

🔹 Positioning is everything
The winners will:
1. Invest in senior, CFO-ready talent that sponsors trust.
2. Diversify services (ops, tech, analytics) so revenue isn’t tied only to dealflow.
3. Stay close enough to PE activity to ride the wave up — but broad enough to avoid being stranded when the tide recedes.

Leading indicators fix that by moving Finance closer to 𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘴 instead of 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘴.

Why they matter:

#1  Early warning
Spot inflections weeks sooner (pipeline quality, delivery times, churn risk).

#2  Sharper scenarios
Translate signal shifts into ranges, not guesses.

#3  Better decisions
Reallocate budget and headcount before variances grow.

#4  Less bias
Observable inputs beat wishful thinking in reviews.

#5  Stronger partnerships
Finance becomes the hub connecting Sales, Ops, Product, and HR.

Are we structurally ready to grow — no matter which capital path we take?

Aprio’s latest move — acquiring Mize CPAs Inc. ($47M, 300+ people) and Prism ($1.8B AUM) — shows where the bar is being set. Backed by #PE, they’re building a full-stack platform: tax, advisory, payroll, wealth, even law.

But here’s the takeaway for regional firms:
👉 The disciplines that PE sponsors insist on aren’t about making life harder. They’re the same disciplines that unlock growth while independent.

→ Centralized decision-making across partners and service lines.
→ Bullet-proof KPIs — sliceable by client, industry, partner, service.
→ Real-time insights so you can course-correct before a board (or banker) ever asks.

- 100 CFOs
- Sheraton, Dubai 
- September 26th

Yes, there will be food, cocktails, and networking.

But this isn’t a conference.

It’s an experiment in how finance will be run in the AI era.

Here’s what we’ll dive into:

a) The new skills CFOs need when AI does the reporting.
b) How AI agents are reshaping reconciliation and reporting.
c) Real frameworks and prototypes peers are testing right now.
d) How to turn numbers into narratives the board actually listens to.

You’ll hear from CFOs already experimenting with AI inside their finance teams. You’ll see frameworks you can take home. You’ll walk away with ideas you can put into motion the very next morning.

But the real magic is the energy in the room.

Honest conversations.

Lessons that don’t make it to LinkedIn but change the way you work.

Finance teams couldn’t move at the speed of the business.

What should have been a solution became another bottleneck.

3. Power BI stopped at the past

We could respond in hours — because we had already built the reporting cube long before bankers showed up.

That’s the real miss for most firms:
You don’t build “PE-ready” finance in the middle of a process.
You build it 12–18 months in advance — or risk value, timeline, and even your seat.

And the clock is ticking.
PE ownership has already hit a third of the Top 30 firms, and it’s quickly moving through the Top 100.

That’s why I built the PE-Readiness Diagnostic — a 2-week pressure test of whether your team can deliver when diligence turns up the heat:
→ Customer-level revenue cuts
→ Acquisition breakouts tied to consolidated numbers
→ Recurring vs. re-occurring vs. non-recurring revenue
→ Scenario models under pressure

If your firm is even considering PE in the next 12–24 months, now is the time.

They didn’t grow up in the same country.
They didn’t train in the same discipline.
They didn’t look at problems the same way.

And that’s exactly why they outperformed.

Over my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with teams across more than 14 countries
Finance specialists in Latin America.
Tech innovators in Europe.
Cross-functional teams in the U.S. and Asia.

Different cultures. Different lenses. Different ways of thinking.
What I saw again and again is that diverse teams don’t just work differently.
They work better.

They make stronger decisions.
Blind spots get challenged earlier.
Assumptions don’t go unchecked.
And the result is a solution that stands up under pressure.

They innovate faster.
Some of the best ideas I’ve seen came from people “outside” the expected domain.
A marketer at Coca-Cola influenced how I built a finance model.
A data scientist in SaaS reshaped how I thought about forecasting.
Cross-pollination creates breakthroughs.

And they build resilience.
In startups especially, volatility is constant.
Multicultural and cross-functional teams bring more problem-solving tools to the table.
They don’t just react differently, they anticipate differently.
That makes them harder to break when uncertainty hits.

The lesson? Numbers may be universal.
But the way we get to them improves dramatically when diverse voices are in the room.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7375865220902227968,2025-09-22 12:15:05.612,"I spoke to a CFO of a $300 million company who said, Every financial metric is bullshit. And EBITDA is also bullshit. My first thought... Really? 

He then said, If you only look at EBITDA.

This CFO doesn’t hate EBITDA.
He says people just use it wrong. 
No single number tells the whole story.

Don't just look at one metric. 
Look at everything together.

He uses EBITDA as a starting point to break down the business:

1. Breaks down the business

He doesn't just check the total company EBITDA. He uses EBITDA for all specific profits from each part of the business or sales area. This means he sees the direct money made and spent by each piece of the business.

2. Asks better questions

This detailed view changes everything. He asks direct, action-focused questions: Is our main office (back office) costing too much compared to what each sales area brings in? Do specific sales areas need to sell more, make more profit, or cut their own direct costs?

3. Drives real action

By focusing on sales areas, locations, and other key parts, he moves beyond just reporting. This approach helps him find problems, pushing for real fixes. He tells the full, complex business story, not just one number.

TAKEAWAY

EBITDA isn't bullshit when it shows how well each part of the business performs and makes money. It's a tool that breaks down big ideas, points to growth, and helps make smarter calls.

Real money insight comes from:

- Connecting the dots.
- Seeing the full picture.
- Using every number as a piece of a bigger puzzle.

Metrics are just signals. On their own, they’re meaningless.

But layer them, compare them, and pressure-test your assumptions.

Now you’re doing real finance.

If you obsess over one number, you’re missing the story.

So everything is bullshit unless you see the full picture.

Because too many FP&A decks drown in detail and never land the point.

Here's how:

1. Lead with the main insight (top of the pyramid)
   
Stop building 40 slides before stating the point.
Say: Our margin plan is off by 3 points next quarter. Here's the fix.
Not: Here are 20 pages of variances.
Executives want the answer first. Context second.
   
2. Support with key arguments (middle of the pyramid)

Don't just show numbers. Show tradeoffs:

  - Revenue vs. margin: Each 1% price discount costs us $2M in profit
  - Growth vs. cash: Expanding to Asia requires $5M but doubles TAM
  - Investment vs. risk: Delaying tech upgrade saves $3M but risks 15% productivity loss
   
Frame choices that matter. Cut everything else.
   
3. Back it with data and facts (base of the pyramid)

Then bring in the models, sensitivity tables, and scenarios.
Data is not the story. It's the proof.
Build what drives decisions, drop what doesn't.

Make it work:

- Use scenarios to show impact
- Create role-specific dashboards
- Automate routine reporting (save 15 hours/week)

Remember:

- Insights drive action
- Data validates the path
- Arguments shape choices

FP&A doesn't move the business by predicting.
It moves it by forcing clarity at the table.

People see the headlines:
100 CFOs in Dubai. Food. Cocktails. Networking.

But it’s not easy to bring this caliber of people into one room.

It’s weeks of chasing confirmations.
It’s countless back-and-forth conversations.
It’s politely declining vendors who want to sneak in.
It’s making sure the mix is right, not just titles, but mindsets.

And sometimes, it feels like trying to solve a 1,000-piece puzzle while the pieces keep changing shape.

“I love to put together a 50-page slide deck every month.”

“Yeah, and I can’t wait to read each and every slide.”

Said no one ever.

Yet, preparing comprehensive decks to report company performance is still the norm at most firms.

But, there’s an alternative:

One-Pagers.

Procter & Gamble and Amazon fully embrace them.

When I was at P&G, the GM I worked with refused to look at any deck or document unless it fit on one page.

Similarly, a friend told me that when he started a new job at Amazon, he was confused about why no one would say anything at the beginning of a big meeting.

People would just sit there with their heads down.

That’s because they all read the One Pager at the beginning of each decision meeting.

The business changes daily.

Here are 3 traits of a modern finance nervous system:

1. Integrated
CRM tells you real demand; HRIS tells you real supply; ERP/banks tell you real cash; product telemetry tells you real unit economics. The model ingests all of it continuously.

2. Driver-led
No mystical oracle. Explicit drivers that can be challenged: price, volume, churn, mix, hiring, ramp, comp ratios, discount ladders, and CAC/LTV by segment.

3. Conversational
Not a dashboard. But a Q&A that answers your question and reshapes the view for your role. (“As the CXO for EMEA, why did my renewals slide?” → Your SMB segment in DE saw a competitor launch; attach rate fell 14%; here are the affected accounts and playbooks.)

There won’t be one magic algorithm that predicts the future.

Finance is too multi-causal
internal drivers + external shocks + qualitative context.

The answer is a hybrid system:

Deterministic logic where rules are stable 
(revenue recognition, headcount math)

Probabilistic models where patterns are noisy 
(pipeline conversion, seasonality)

Human narrative where the truth lives outside the data 
(competitive moves, partner failures, supplier strikes)

The future of FP&A is not prettier dashboards. 

It’s a shorter time-to-decision.

REMEMBER

The most valuable deliverable in the CFO Office will be the Decision Brief.

In my last post, I shared why the old way of budgeting doesn’t work anymore in professional services.
The same goes for long-range planning (LRP).

That’s why, for a limited time, I’m still offering my traditional Professional Services LRP for free (link in comments). It’s still highly relevant across many parts of the PS business model and can create real value.

But here’s the reality:
• SG&A is heavier. Tech, BD, and enablement costs are rising.
• Capex is higher. AI, automation, and platforms are now table stakes.
• Efficiency > headcount. Growth depends on getting more from the team you already have.

We’ve entered the AI Economy. 
The finance job is gone.

Finance teams don’t spend weeks chasing reconciliations or grinding through forecasts. AI Agents build, test, and refresh models in real time.

Variance analysis is instant.
Month-end close takes seconds.
Board decks assemble overnight with commentary already written.

CFOs aren’t Chief Accountants anymore.

They’re Chief Storytellers.

They don’t present 60-slide decks. 

They stand in front of the board and say:

Here’s the risk.
Here’s what matters. 
Here’s the path forward.

Controllers don’t manage accountants.

They manage fleets of bots, self-driving finance engines that reconcile, audit, and flag anomalies before they happen.

FP&A isn’t about spreadsheets.

It’s about asking sharper questions:

- What trade-off matters most right now?
- Which lever actually moves the business?
- How do we tell the story of tomorrow, not just record yesterday?

Displaced workers are lured with eye-popping salaries and equity.

GDP is exploding.

In just 6 months, AI systems have advanced the equivalent of 100 years of human progress. Agent collectives read, write, and think hundreds of times faster than us.

Institutions rise and fall in weeks.

New scientific revolutions happen before you've finished your morning coffee.

By 2028, finance’s rituals are gone.

The grind is automated.

What’s left is judgment, story, and courage.

And that’s why the finance leader’s role has never mattered more.

The finance job is gone. 

The finance leader is being born.

Christian Watting,christian-wattig,inspiration,7374811675121643520,2025-09-19 14:28:40.724,"Don't make this FP&A mistake:

Sharing your performance review report immediately after the month-end close is done.

Why?

It doesn't give you enough time to uncover what caused variances and what to do about it.

To get there, you need to dig into operational data and collaborate with your cross-functional business partners.

And that takes time.

So, I recommend you do what my former teams at Unilever, P&G, and Squarespace have been doing:

Submit a ""Flash Report"" immediately after the close that highlights variances between actuals and expectations (= prior forecast, budget, and prior year). 

But: Don't yet attempt to explain WHY behind the variances. That comes later.

I'll explain exactly how to create the Flash Report at my next webinar 👇

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7374809890231459840,2025-09-19 14:21:35.173,"💡 Confession: I posted about budgeting in professional services earlier.
And as soon as I hit ""Post"", I realized I’d lost the plot.

I framed budgeting the way I’ve done it successfully in the past — lock revenue, back into hiring, manage gross margin.

That worked in the old paradigm: more people → more hours → more revenue.

But the ground has shifted.
We’re not in a headcount-driven world anymore.

👉 Today’s budgeting paradigm is about efficiency, not just expansion:
→ More revenue per FTE
→ Comp increases + retention to protect your best people
→ Cross-practice leverage to balance utilization
→ L&D and higher-value services to push up realization and pricing
→ AI, automation, and platforms to free capacity and scale smarter

In other words, the budget conversation is no longer just:
“How many people do we need?”

It’s: “How do we get more from the team we have — and what investments unlock that?”

Budgeting for 2026 isn’t a spreadsheet drill.
It’s a strategic design exercise for growth, talent, and technology in a new paradigm.

At Saperia Consulting LLC, I help Accounting & Professional Services executives adapt to this shift.

Most AI outputs are unusable in finance:

Confidential data feels unsafe in the cloud. Other tools hallucinate data, forcing you to rebuild from scratch. ChatGPT produces numbers but hard-codes every cell. No traceability. No inputs.

But Claude solves all of this:

Reusable: Extend the same model over time.
Auditable: Formulas and inputs you can verify.
Safe: Build with dummy data, then paste in actuals locally.
Complex: Handles real-world finance complexity, not toy examples.

This is the first time Excel can truly think with you.

Yesterday, I showed 25,000 CFOs how AI can understand existing models and make changes and even find errors. Claude can make changes to an existing FP&A model natively inside Excel.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7374778038514778114,2025-09-19 12:15:01.132,"5 FP&A metrics CEOs and CFOs want:

1. Revenue Growth 
   
Forget vanity metrics. Your 15% growth means nothing if it's built on unsustainable discounts and desperate end-of-quarter pushes. FP&A needs to expose the uncomfortable truth: which revenue streams will survive a market correction? 
   
Create a sustainability score for each revenue stream based on customer retention costs and pricing power.
   
2. Profitability 
   
Your margins are lying to you. That 40% gross margin hides profit-draining customers and resource-hungry products. Break down profitability by customer cohorts and product lifecycles. 
   
Implement contribution margin tracking by customer segment. You'll be shocked which key accounts actually destroy value.
   
3. Cash Flow 
   
Your quarterly cash flow statements are useless in today's market. You need real-time cash intelligence. That means daily position tracking and weekly forecast updates. 
   
Build a cash stress test model that shows how many weeks you'll survive if your top 3 customers stop paying.
   
4. Budget Variance  
   
Your budget process is broken. Departments manipulate targets, hoard resources, and play political games. Track variance patterns that expose these behaviors. 
   
Create a budget gaming index that flags suspicious patterns in departmental requests and spending.
   
5. Return on Investment 
   
Stop accepting fancy ROI presentations with cherry-picked assumptions. Every investment needs three scenarios: expected, worst-case, and disaster. 
   
Implement a reality check score that compares projected ROIs against actual historical returns.
   

FP&A must:

a. Drive decisions with real data

b. Expose hidden financial realities

c. Force uncomfortable conversations

After 40 years, Excel can now truly think with CFOs:

Imagine you have a working model. It is fragile. Held together by yellow input cells, copy-paste patches, and late-night duct tape.

Now your CEO walks in and says:

Can we see the impact of Non-HR OPEX shifting 3% each month? Keep HR costs untouched. Update EBITDA, cash, and the charts. And don’t break the layout.

Every FP&A analyst knows what happens next:

Breaking links that once worked.
Charts that suddenly stop updating.
Hours lost tracing formulas through a maze of tabs.
Stress testing the model line by line just to make sure nothing silently blew up.

This is Excel hell.

And it has defined finance for 40 years.

But here is the breakthrough.

Claude can now understand your existing model, make precise changes, and keep it intact with a single prompt.

This is huge and a real breakthrough in finance.

Claude can now generate real Excel models.

Not hard-coded outputs, not throwaway tables, but fully traceable, auditable, and reusable spreadsheets.

Type your business logic in plain English, and in minutes you get:

- Formulas you can audit line by line.
- Models that update month after month.
- Driver-based forecasts with adjustable parameters.

They came from moving across four very different ones.

Consumer goods at Coca-Cola.
Travel tech at Expedia.
Electric vehicles at Pure Watercraft.
SaaS & AI at Gain.

On paper, those businesses don’t look alike.
Different models. Different customers. Different challenges.
But working across them taught me things I never would’ve learned if I had stayed in one lane.

Switching industries forces you to adapt fast.
Every sector speaks its own language—
SKU margins in consumer goods.
CAC and LTV in SaaS.
Manufacturing cycles in EVs.
The only way forward is to get comfortable being uncomfortable.

It also trains you to spot patterns others miss.
What worked in travel analytics later became the foundation for real-time forecasting in SaaS.
Innovation rarely comes from reinventing the wheel.
It comes from cross-pollination.

And it gives you perspective.
Coca-Cola taught me scale.
Expedia taught me agility.
Pure Watercraft taught me capital intensity.
Gain taught me recurring revenue dynamics.
Each lens sharpens the next.

The real benefit? Resilience.
Every industry goes through cycles.
Tech booms and busts.
Consumer demand shifts.
EVs ride hype waves and funding droughts.

2025: President & COFO at Salesforce

Robin Washington is the first woman to become Chief Operating and Financial Officer (COFO) at a Fortune 100 company.

The traditional CFO role is ending within Fortune 100 and beyond. But the CFO isn’t trying to become the COO. They always were. 

CFOs ran:

- Vendor stack
- GTM execution
- Data architecture
- Planning systems
- Headcount strategy
- Risk, cash, and compliance

Operations today aren’t about warehouses.

It’s about dashboards, decisions, and precision.

And no one understands those levers better than Finance.

You can’t scale decision-making if finance and operations live in silos. In high-functioning teams, shared accountability is dead. They want one leader who sees it all. And owns the outcome. 

That leader is the CFO. 

Not the spreadsheet CFO.

But the one who speaks GTM fluently.

Who talks in tradeoffs, not just budgets.

Who connects cost to capacity to culture.

The one who doesn’t just ask, Can we afford it?

But says, Does this even make sense?

Robin Washington runs finance and operations at a $300B+ cloud giant. The COFO badge isn’t about vanity.

+ If you are not sure, join my next masterclass: https://lnkd.in/einkvr_2

I will explain to you which AI tool you should choose for Finance

And also I will showcase my secrets on how to become an AI CFO!
1. Financial Analysis with AI
2. Scenario Modeling
3. AI Roadmap and more!


Which GenAI should you actually use
ChatGPT or Copilot?

That’s a question I get a lot

That’s why I created this guide for you.

Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:

→ Crete Professionals Alliance (Thrive-backed) plans to deploy $500M+ into acquisitions and AI upgrades, already surging past $300M revenue.
→ Prosperity Partners (Unity-backed) was #2 on Accounting Today’s 2025 Fastest-Growing Firms, expanding through multiple acquisitions.
→ Springline Advisory (Trinity Hunt) and Platform AG are rolling up boutiques into regional platforms.
→ Incumbents like Citrin Cooperman, Grant Thornton, and BDO are reshaping themselves with PE or private credit.

And now Aline Accounting Partners is testing something new: a $100M debt package with a $57.8M DDTL to fund add-ons. Starting from just $21M, they could add $40–60M and vault into the Top 100—without a disclosed PE sponsor.

It’s the same consolidation spectrum, but with a new twist: private credit as the driver instead of private equity.

When I was more junior, my wife and I took our 8-month-old to visit her grandparents in Romania. On New Year’s Eve, while the family feasted on Sarmale (Romanian stuffed cabbage — IYKYK), I was hunched over my laptop obsessing over budget scenarios.

The process hadn’t been designed properly from the start — and the cost was personal.

That’s what happens when #budgeting is treated as a spreadsheet drill instead of a strategic process:
– Infighting over departmental dollars
– Analysts building models with no strategy behind them
– Deadlines blown
– Teams grinding through the holidays when it should already be locked down

It was a real learning experience, and I never let that happen again.

If you’re an #accounting firm with a December fiscal year-end, your Annual Operating Plan (AOP) process should already be underway — or kicking off right now.

Otherwise, you risk not only missed deadlines, but also missed time with family. And that’s time you don’t get back — whether it’s stuffed cabbage or whatever special treat is on your family’s table.

After 10+ years leading these cycles for consulting and accounting firms, I’ve seen two outcomes:
✅ Strategic AOPs that align leadership and chart growth
❌ Budgets that devolve into expense allocations no one revisits

For #ManagingPartners, this isn’t about spreadsheets — it’s one of the most important levers you have to set direction.

👉 So — at your firm, is #budget season a roadmap for growth… or an expense drill?

Door 1: Denial.

Repaint the dashboards. Rename the meetings. Talk about AI at offsites, and deploy nothing that moves basis points. You’ll keep the calendar. You’ll lose the room.

Door 2: Delegation theater.

Spin up an AI task force, outsource the thinking to vendors, and pray compliance signs off. You’ll have pilots and press releases. You won’t have decisions that ship faster.

Door 3: Design.

Rewrite the operating system under the seat you already own. Build a forward model wired to CRM/HRIS/banks. Pilot one augmentation that pays in basis points. Replace the deck with a 2-page Decision Brief. Publish a Finance AI policy that is boring, strict, and keeps you employed. Run a weekly judgment lab so your team earns the reps machines can’t.

Only one of these doors ends with you defining the role that replaces the one that’s ending.

For us, it was about the power of Microsoft Fabric’s translytical approach and the shift it creates when planning, forecasting, and reporting all happen in the same space with instant updates flowing across the business.

This is not just a technology milestone. It is a new way for finance, sales, and operations teams to work. No more disconnected reports. No more static forecasts. Instead, decisions are made in real-time, grounded in a single shared truth.

They fail because the finances were.

I’ve seen it across industries
From SaaS to EVs to consumer goods.
The pattern repeats itself every time.

The first blind spot is cash flow mismanagement.
Revenue might be climbing.
The pipeline might be full.
But if cash is trapped in receivables or inventory, the business runs out of oxygen.
Profit on paper doesn’t matter if you can’t make payroll.

The second blind spot is scaling too fast.
I’ve watched companies add headcount, launch products, and pour money into marketing before proving the model.
It feels like momentum, until the burn rate outruns reality.
Growth without a financial foundation is just acceleration toward a cliff.

The third blind spot is poor forecasting.
Too many startups rely on spreadsheets built for today.
Static, fragile, already outdated by the time the quarter ends.
Without rolling forecasts and scenario planning, leadership reacts instead of anticipates.
And by the time they see the wall, it’s too late to swerve.

Here’s the truth 
Startups don’t need perfect forecasts.
They need realistic ones.
Ones that show exactly when cash will run out.
And what levers they can pull to extend runway.

Because surviving isn’t about brilliance.
It’s about clarity.
And clarity is what separates the startups that die from the ones that endure.

You built muscle memory in Excel. You reconciled a thousand ledgers. You survived the make-it-by-Monday board asks.

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7373358637421076480,2025-09-15 14:14:49.54,"The Best Leadership Advice I’ve Read This Month

Last week, my colleague Danika R., VP of Operations at Gain, published an article that really stayed with me: “If I Had 15 Minutes With Every Person on My Team, Here’s What I’d Say.”

Her message was simple but profound:
→ Be quick to listen, but not quick to respond.
→ Use the tools, but don’t lose your judgment.
→ And above all, remember there’s a real person on the other side of every file.

I’ve had the privilege of working alongside Danika, and I’ve seen her lead with exactly these principles. 

In a high-stakes, high-speed business, it’s easy to focus on efficiency alone. What Danika reminds us is that efficiency without empathy is fragile.

As finance leaders, we talk a lot about data, forecasting, and strategy. But the same truth applies in finance as in operations: it’s not just what gets done it’s how we show up that defines us.

Danika’s perspective is a powerful reminder that culture, empathy, and human connection aren’t “soft skills” they’re competitive advantages.

I encourage you to read her article, Link in comment",22,4,0,26,18.18,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_the-best-leadership-advice-ive-read-this-activity-7373358637421076480-sswt
Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7373337122776457216,2025-09-15 12:49:20.049,"KPIs are in style. Every “strategic finance” professional throws around the term. But let’s break down how strategic they actually are.

In professional services, the big KPIs are well known:
● Utilization rate
● Realization rate
● Revenue per consultant
● Gross margin by client

Useful? Absolutely. Actionable? Rarely. By the time utilization dips or realization falls, the damage is already done. These KPIs are lagging indicators.

That’s why I’ve been leaning into a different lens: aKPIs — actionable KPIs.

👉 aKPIs measure the levers you can pull today.
Examples of professional services aKPIs:
● Pipeline health aKPI: % of proposals delivered within 5 business days of client request.
● Engagement efficiency aKPI: # of proactive scope-change conversations initiated with clients.
● Talent leverage aKPI: Hours delivered by associates vs. partners on major accounts.
● Client success aKPI: % of deliverables reviewed internally 48+ hours before deadlines.

But here’s the nuance: simply calling something an aKPI isn’t enough.
For an aKPI to actually drive results, you need infrastructure:

1. Real-time tracking → If an aKPI is only updated monthly, it’s no longer actionable. Weekly or daily visibility is a must.
2. Lever maps → For each aKPI, you need a clear process map: “When this metric slips, here are the 2–3 levers to pull.” Otherwise, you’re monitoring without action.
3. Trigger systems → Alerts and dashboards that surface drift in time to act — not just in time to report.

That’s when an aKPI becomes more than a number. It becomes a control system.

I was inspired to sharpen this framing in a conversation with Soufyan Hamid, who’s been pushing the finance community to rethink how we measure and communicate performance.

🔹 Curious to hear: what’s one KPI you’ve turned into an aKPI, and how have you built the systems to make it truly actionable?",19,11,1,31,57.89,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathansaperia_kpis-are-in-style-every-strategic-finance-activity-7373337122776457216-MYDo

• Cash flow is optimized before you even ask. 
• Forecasts adjust automatically with live market data.

⤷ Great FP&A Analyst

CFO: I need a forecast for next quarter's revenue.

Great FP&A Analyst: Understood. Before I start, can we discuss our key growth initiatives and any market changes that might impact our revenue?

CFO: Sure, we're launching a new product line and expanding into a new market.

Great FP&A Analyst: Got it. I'll work with the sales and marketing teams to incorporate those factors into the forecast. I can provide an initial view in a week, and we can refine it as we get more data on the new initiatives.

- Providing actionable insights
- Collaborating across departments
- Aligning forecasts with strategic initiatives

Many finance teams create variance analysis that doesn't move the needle.

I've seen that again and again when I trained more than 1,000 finance professionals over the course of the last three years.

At the same time, identifying concrete opportunities that drive growth and profitability is a core task of an effective FP&A team.

Here is what I learned about how to get your variance analysis to the next level:

Step 1: The What

This step involves identifying and quantifying the variance. It's about determining the difference between the actual results and the budgeted or forecasted figures.

Step 2: The Why

Once the variance is identified, the next step is to understand the reasons behind it. This involves analyzing the factors that contributed to the deviation.

Step 3: The So What

The final step involves interpreting the significance of the variance and its implications for the business. This step is crucial for decision-making. It helps in assessing the need for corrective actions or strategy adjustments.

I created this infographic to dive deeper into the ""What, Why, So What"" framework for variance analysis.

I spoke to a CFO who said:

I spend most of my day in Excel. I build reports, check reconciliations, and update forecasts. But if you asked me what decisions I changed this week? 

None. Not a single one. 

Then he stirred his coffee slowly, staring into the foam and laughed, but it wasn’t the easy laugh of someone making a joke. It was the bitter laugh of someone who knows the truth but rarely says it out loud.

Finance jobs are hollowing out.

Not because people aren’t working hard.

But because the work itself no longer matters the way it used to.

Walk through any headquarters during month-end. The intensity is real.

- Analysts chasing variances.
- FP&A grinding out updated forecasts.
- Controllers double-checking consolidations.

It feels important. It looks precise.

But scratch beneath the surface and you see a different story.

Much of the work is about proving control, not creating clarity. Reports are circulated but unread. Forecasts expire before they’re approved. Meetings multiply, but decisions stall.

The board packs get thicker every quarter. 

Nobody remembers the last time a single page changed an actual decision. We keep adding layers of polish, as if perfection itself creates value.

But perfection without impact is theater.

You prided yourself on mastering Excel shortcuts. On pulling late nights to reconcile. On being the one who could get the numbers right.

These are rituals.

Now after AI, these rituals feel empty.

But your job isn’t to preserve rituals.

Your job is to create clarity and shape action.

What comes next is better:

Finance that ships decisions, not decks. Finance that runs on real-time agents, not manual closes. Finance that uses stories to move strategy, not slides to prove activity.

The job you thought you had is ending. 

The work you always wanted, the chance to tell the truth, frame the story, and drive the business forward, is finally here: https://lnkd.in/dr2h_55m

Having led 11 annual budgeting processes at P&G, Unilever, and Squarespace...

I realized that each time we go through five distinct phases.

Whether the planning process is a success or a failure depends on how well you manage each of them:

📌 Phase 1: Pre Kick-Off - ""Planning the Plan""

What you should do upfront:

• Review the previous year's plan
• Create the planning roadmap
• Implement process improvements

📌 Phase 2: Joint Planning - ""Any Questions?""

Partnering with the cross-functional team:

• Business teams create the bottom-up plan
• FP&A creates the top-down plan
• Together, FP&A and business teams compare plans, discuss variances, and - crucially - assess risks and opportunities

📌 Phase 3: Consolidation - ""What's the bottom-line?""

The finance team collects inputs and creates consolidated financial statements:

• Consolidation must be fast to avoid playing catch-up with new assumptions
• Consider using a planning system instead of just Excel to drastically simplify the process

📌 Phase 4: Iteration - ""If once you don't succeed...""

Most of the time, the first round of inputs doesn't meet expectations:

• Use ranges, scenarios, and contingency plans to make adjustments quickly
• Stick to your deadlines
• Most importantly: Overcommunicate!

📌 Phase 5: Presentation & Final Alignment - ""We are all one team.""

Finance builds the deck and gets leaders on board with the plan:

• Don't just present the financials, include how strategies translate to tactics and how those will be measured
• Quantify how each strategy is likely to impact the financials
• Don't forget an executive summary that highlights the key issues that must be discussed

-> Download the detailed infographic for best practices during each phase

A common problem:

Annual budgeting gets hectic and stressful when people wait until the very last minute to submit their inputs.

📌 That's why I created a FREE mini-course with best practices for setting budget timelines.

You'll learn:

• The critical things you must do BEFORE starting the budgeting process if you want to make it effective  

• How to use the RACI ownership structure framework to assign clear roles and responsibilities to everyone involved  

• Setting budget timelines that guarantee you get your inputs on time using the Staggered Timeline method

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7372604079014928384,2025-09-13 12:16:28.797,"3 reasons why the CFO Playbook is broken

1. The CFO role is not the same
 
The traditional CFO role was built around financial reporting, compliance, and cost control. But CFOs are now expected to:
 
 - Execute strategy.
 - Build pricing models.
 - Partner with the CEO.
 - Lead cross-functional initiatives.
 - Find and capitalize on new revenue opportunities.
 
Financial acumen alone isn’t enough. Operate more like engineers, break down complex challenges, design financial systems, and transform business models.
 
2. AI and automation broke the rules
 
For 40 years, finance used manual processes. Reconciling accounts, reviewing reports, and analyzing historical data. Modern CFOs must:
 
 - Focus on strategy.
 - Use real-time data.
 - Guide business decisions.
 - Leverage AI for forecasting.
 - Automate routine finance tasks.
 
Yet, most CFOs aren’t trained for this shift. They are still focused on past metrics instead of leading a digital transformation in finance.
 
3. The best CFO don't stay in their lane
 
Traditional CFOs operated within finance. They rarely stepped outside their domain. But modern CFOs are deeply involved in:
 
 Operations.
 Optimizing supply chains and business processes.
 
 Technology.
 Implementing AI, cloud-based ERPs, and automation tools.
 
 Product Strategy.
 Ensuring pricing and investments align with market demand.
 
 Customer Engagement.
 Understanding how finance decisions impact customer experience.
 
Modern CFOs operate across the entire business.
 
TAKEAWAY

The CFO role isn’t about following a predefined career path.

It’s about how you think, execute, and lead.

The best CFOs:

Push their companies forward.
Use AI to drive business results.
Challenge outdated finance models.

If you’re still following the old CFO playbook, you can stop it today.

It’s time to rethink the role and lead the future of finance.",117,17,13,147,14.53,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wouterborn_3-reasons-why-the-cfo-playbook-is-broken-activity-7372604079014928384-cHjq

Top 100 Excel shortcuts: https://lnkd.in/e_ZRnM6a
(Shortcuts for the adults!)

When you were a kid, math felt like magic.
You typed numbers on a calculator, and suddenly it gave you an answer

Now imagine explaining to a kid what Excel can do…
It’s not just about numbers

It’s about keeping scores, making colorful charts, 
or even tracking pocket money savings

That’s the beauty of Excel:
It organizes chaos into tidy tables
It turns boring rows into bright charts that tell stories

It reduces mistakes by doing the math exactly the same way every time.
And the formulas?

Think of them like little spells:
=AVERAGE() finds the “middle” score in your test results
=MAX() shows your highest video-game score
=COUNT() tells how many days you practiced piano

It’s like magic dominoes: change one number, and the entire sheet updates instantly

That’s why I made this visual guide Excel Explained to Kids
to show how powerful (and fun) it can be

Every month, you probably need to manually merge CSVs, categorize expenses, and reformat reports just to get through close.
Copy. Paste. Repeat

That was my case for some of my accounting process in my business.

So built a simple automation stack using AI — and shaved hours off my month-end process.

Here’s how you can do the same

✅ Traditional Automation – Python + Google Sheets

✅ AI Workflows – Custom GPTs for document processing

✅ AI Agents – Trigger-based actions to handle tasks automatically

----

Here are 3 practical ways finance teams can use AI to save time, reduce errors, and focus on higher-value work:

1️⃣ Automating the Close with AI

- Use Python scripts or Google Apps Script to clean, merge, and format data
- Automate file cleanup in Google Sheets or Excel
- No more manually removing empty rows or formatting columns


2️⃣ AI for Expense Categorization

One of the biggest time-wasters? Manually categorizing expenses.
You can automate this using a Custom GPT:

Steps include:
- Create your GPT
- Upload a CSV
- Let GPT classify expenses by category
- Download a clean, categorized report for upload

One finance pro from the AI Finance Club eliminated 90% of manual expense categorization using this!

3️⃣ Categorization Agent

📥 With tools like n8n, you can:

- Detect incoming CSV files
- Clean data with formatting rules
- Use AI to categorize each transaction
- Output everything neatly into a single file

As a hiring manager, I interviewed dozens of FP&A job candidates. 

Now I'm sharing my insights to help you land your FP&A dream job.

What to expect at FP&A hiring manager interviews:

• FP&A is a blend of technical and interpersonal skills, so expect questions about both.
  
• Prepare for technical questions about budgeting, forecasting, financial modeling, financial analysis, and reporting.
  
• Interpersonal skill-related questions may be about business partnering, which includes advising, challenging, and influencing others, and building relationships, or they center around financial storytelling.
  
• The most popular approach is to ask so-called “behavioral questions.” These questions begin with “tell me about a time when you did x” or “give me an example of y.”  They require that you share a concrete example of your prior work experience.
  
• Behavioral questions are preferred over traditional questions such as “how would you approach situation x?” 
  
  That’s because concrete examples of past performance lend themselves better to deeper follow-up questions that aim to probe beyond prepared remarks.

I used to think becoming a CFO meant I’d finally made it.

The title. The boardroom. The strategy. The upside.

But here’s the part that doesn’t show up in the headlines:
→ It’s lonely.
→ You’re constantly on the hook.
→ If anything breaks, your name’s the first on the list.
→ And yes—at every level up the finance ladder, I’ve worked more, not less.

In private equity-backed companies, CFO turnover is sky-high.
Why?
A mix of burnout + zero tolerance for underperformance.
The expectations are brutal—and not always realistic.

To the up-and-comers in finance:

I know it’s tempting to chase the title.
But make sure you know what you’re really signing up for.
It’s not prestige. It’s pressure.
It’s not just numbers. It’s narrative, politics, and accountability.

👉 To the CFOs out there:
I respect you more than you can imagine.
You carry a weight most people never see.
You hold the line when no one else can.

If you want to become a CFO, do it.
But do it for the right reasons:
→ Because you love owning the outcome
→ Because you can lead through chaos
→ Because you’re willing to be the one who stays calm when everyone else panics

CFOs used to hire analysts for this:

3 days later you’d get a model. Sometimes 3 weeks. And you’d pray the formulas worked. But Claude can do it in 5 minutes.

Now that’s an analyst’s job, done by AI.

The difference isn't just about working harder... it's about working smarter. 

I've learned this the hard way, having worked my way up from Junior FP&A Analyst to leading FP&A and accounting teams at Unilever and Squarespace.

How the 𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘦 FP&A Analyst works:

📌 Analysis
Identifies which line items cause variances between actuals and forecasts.

📌 Reporting
Reports timely and accurate financial metrics related to sales growth and profitability.

📌 Business Partnering
Shares relevant data with cross-functional business partners.

📌 Financial Modeling
Uses strong Excel skills to build complex, sophisticated models. 

📌 Forecasting
Uses and refines the same forecasting technique every month.


How a 𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘬𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘳 FP&A Analyst makes a difference:

📌 Analysis
Identifies root causes (”The So What”) and changes to trends that influence decision-making.

📌 Reporting
Combines operational and financial metrics to show how leading indicators will likely impact the financials.

📌 Business Partnering
Makes concrete recommendations that help business partners reach their goals.

📌 Financial Modeling
Creates Excel models that are well-documented and optimized for ease of use and fast iteration.

📌 Forecasting
Experiments with different forecasting techniques in every cycle to adapt to business changes.

- Scale
- Structure
- Calculation

But for 40 years, nothing truly changed.

Until now, Anthropic’s Claude built a 24-month SaaS forecast in 5 minutes with formulas, drivers, and a live cash chart.

Traceable formulas.
Yellow-highlighted driver cells.
Churn, MRR, opex, fundraising assumptions built in.
A cash burn chart showing exactly when the company runs out of money.

Now that’s an analyst’s job, done by AI.

I copy-pasted a prompt. Claude built the model.

When I opened Excel, it was live and working.

It was about learning how different teams approached the same challenges—
And how those perspectives shaped the bigger financial picture.

At Coca-Cola.
At Pure Watercraft.

So if you act like one, the company suffers.

The old CFO worried primarily about accounting principles and compliance. The new CFO focuses on the business itself.

CFOs must:

- Provoke new thinking.
- Challenge the status quo.
- Guide the company toward growth.

The modern CFO must lead with 3 things:

1. Agility.
2. Confidence.
3. True strategic depth.

Don't be enslaved by the numbers. 

You must command them.

This is the future of finance.

AI handles the bad, repetitive work.

So you can focus on truly partnering with the business.

Go and sit down with the COO.

Go and sit down with the other departments.

Challenge what's going on... and be more prepared.

(research-based)

1. Build mental models

Think of mental models as your internal map for understanding financial systems. They help you predict how changes in one area affect the whole picture. A landmark 2024 study of 1.6M analyst reports revealed that top performers use focused, forward-looking mental models to cut through complexity. These frameworks help you spot patterns, test assumptions, and make better recommendations with less effort.

2. Expose data weaknesses

Data is the backbone of FP&A. But not all data is created equal. Research reveals that poor data quality costs businesses an average of 15-25% in revenue loss. Learn to spot inconsistencies and validate sources. FP&A teams with strong data validation processes show 40% higher forecast accuracy.

3. Master emotional control

In FP&A, pressure and tough conversations are daily. Mastering emotional control means staying calm and clear-headed when stakes are high. Research shows analysts with strong emotional intelligence make better risk decisions and handle complex situations more effectively. A 2024 study links high EI to superior financial performance, particularly in high-pressure environments.

4. Prioritization & Time management

Juggling multiple requests is a daily reality. Focus on what drives value. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: urgent vs. important. Prioritize tasks that influence strategic goals rather than just chasing urgent distractions. This skill reduces burnout and boosts effectiveness.

5. Tech fluency + Adaptability

Excel skills are just the start. Be ready to learn new tools, Power BI, Python, or automation platforms. Research from McKinsey shows that analysts who adapt quickly to tech changes outperform peers and save hours weekly by automating repetitive tasks.

1. AI is underhyped

AI is moving from chat to agentic systems that plan, reason, and run processes end-to-end. The bottleneck isn’t algorithms. It’s power and compute. Schmidt warns the U.S. may need the equivalent of 90 nuclear plants just to keep up. If one country pulls ahead by months, rivals may see pre-emption, digital or physical, as the only option.

2. Robots are coming for labor costs

Tesla’s Optimus will only work if the hands problem is solved. Musk says once scaled, humanoid robots could cost as little as $20K each. That means CFOs must start modeling robotic labor in OpEx and planning depreciation schedules like you would for machinery.

3. Silicon + software must co-design

Tesla’s AI5 chip is being built hand-in-hand with the software team. Removing bottlenecks to deliver a 40× jump on key AI tasks. You can’t treat chips and code as separate. Finance must start tracking cost per inference the way we track cloud bills.

4. AI without governance is useless

Palantir’s Alex Karp made it clear: the systems that win will be the hardest to abuse. Immutable logs, permissions, and traceability aren’t nice to haves. For finance, this means demanding auditability in every AI tool before rollout.

5. Optimism beats outrage

The West is struggling with pessimism, low birth rates, and cultural drift. The only way forward is optimism and execution. For builders, that means shipping, not debating. For CFOs, that means backing bold bets, not just safe spreadsheets.

If you look at the bigger picture, these aren’t abstract ideas. 

Consider them as signals of where capital, labor, and technology are moving. Eric Schmidt stood out and great talk by Elon Musk.

3 things CFOs want from FP&A:

1. Help CFOs make profitable decisions

Spot risks before they become visible. Identify trends, anomalies, and shifts in real-time. Give CFOs the data to anticipate, not react.

2. Turn complex data into actionable insights

CFOs do not need raw numbers. They need answers. Summarize financials with clarity, not complexity. Help them focus on decisions, not data overload.

3. Prepare scenario models faster

Best, worst, and likely case scenarios reduce uncertainty. CFOs need options, not guesses. The right model helps companies pivot fast.

Let's be clear: 

You can't grow if you rely on static Excel models.

You don't need to leave Excel. But you do need FP&A tools that integrate AI, automation, and real-time collaboration without forcing you to leave the spreadsheets you trust.

➡️ Parthenon Capital: Embark (OCFO) + Cherry Bekaert (Accounting)
➡️ Unity Partners: Amplēo (OCFO) + Prosperity Partners (Accounting)

Some started with advisory and added accounting. Others did the reverse.
But either way, this isn’t just roll-up economics.
It’s convergence.

Here’s the nuance most don’t see yet:
→ These firms are still being run independently.
→ Same fund, different playbooks.
→ Maybe a little knowledge-sharing… but no real collaboration.

So the question becomes:
🔄 Will we start to see cross-portfolio collaboration?
🤝 Will any of these pairs eventually merge into a unified platform?
📈 Will a full-stack “Finance Platform” emerge — spanning audit, tax, CFO services, and FP&A?

I’ve seen this play out too many times.

The finance team works late nights building perfect slides.
Charts are aligned. Fonts are consistent. Every number ties back.

And yet, when the deck hits the table… nothing changes.
Because pretty slides don’t drive strategy.

Here’s the truth:

A finance team that’s focused on presentation instead of perspective is a wasted investment.

Great decks might impress for a moment. Great insights shape decisions for months.

The difference comes down to what you hire for:

→ Do they ask why the numbers look the way they do?
Or do they just copy-paste into slides without questioning the assumptions?

→ Do they connect the data to real business trade-offs?
Or do they just report history without showing what it means for tomorrow?

→ Do they simplify complexity for leadership?
Or do they hide behind jargon and endless tables that no one will use?

Formatting can be outsourced.
Insight cannot.

If your finance team isn’t influencing where to spend, when to hire, or how to manage cash, then you don’t have finance you have reporting.

The best finance teams don’t just track the business.
They change how it runs.

A few reasons why:

1. You build CFO skills early

FP&A sharpens your ability to think like a CFO. You’ll learn how to manage budgets, model scenarios, assess risks, and tell the financial story behind every decision. It’s hands-on training for the top job.

2. You get noticed fast

FP&A pros work closely with leadership. You’ll present insights, challenge decisions, and influence big moves. That kind of exposure builds trust and opens doors to roles like CFO and VP of Finance.

3. You’re part of the strategy

Traditional finance jobs (like accounting or audit) often trap you in routine work. FP&A puts you in the action. You forecast, analyze, advise, and help drive the business forward. It’s strategic, not just technical.

4. You become tech-fluent

Modern FP&A runs on tools like Excel (core), Power BI, and planning platforms like Aimplan. You’ll master data, automate workflows, and build models that drive decisions. Tech isn’t a side skill. It’s core to the job.

This career will keep you sharp, expose you to strategic decisions, and set you up for big opportunities.

1. You hide mistakes

Weak CFOs cover up errors to protect their image. Great CFOs openly admit when financial models fail, clearly explain why, and outline steps to avoid repeating mistakes.

2. You compromise on integrity

Weak CFOs might bend rules to hit short-term targets, losing trust permanently. Great CFOs know integrity means saying ""no"" clearly and confidently, even if it's unpopular.

3. You treat FP&A like a reporting function

Weak CFOs treat FP&A as reporting and data entry. Great CFOs turn FP&A into business partners, using financial insights to guide strategic decisions, such as launching new products or entering new markets.

4. You chase short-term wins

Weak CFOs want quick wins at the expense of long-term stability. Great CFOs look 3-5 years ahead, investing in the right talent, systems, and partnerships to hit growth.

5. You fear new technology

Weak CFOs delay adopting new tools because change feels risky. Great CFOs use AI to improve accuracy in forecasting, manage risks proactively, and streamline routine financial tasks.

6. You confuse employees with complex finance talk

Overloading conversations with jargon might make you sound smart, but it leaves your team in the dark. Great CFOs make finance clear and actionable, helping teams to make informed decisions.

7. You react instead of anticipate

Playing defense is a losing game. Great CFOs stay ahead of problems, anticipate risks, and have solutions before anyone asks.

Weak CFOs play it safe.

Budgeting season is upon us. For finance leaders, that means the hunt for savings has begun.

One of the fastest-growing—and hardest to justify—line items is your software portfolio. 

According to a study conducted by Vertice:

• 66% of all software applications are unused or underutilized.
  
• In 2025, software inflation is running at 495% higher than consumer inflation
  
• The average business spend on software per employee is $9,000 (!) in 2025

Before you're asked to make difficult cuts, what if you could approach your 2026 tech budget with a clear, data-driven plan?

No—calling EBITDA lazy is lazy.

It’s become the go-to dunk for people trying to sound smart.
“Cash is king.” “EBITDA isn’t real.” “CapEx and working capital!”
👏👏👏

But here’s the thing:
If you’re headed toward a transaction, your business will be valued on EBITDA.
Not your cash balance.
Not your GAAP net income.
EBITDA. Full stop.

Why?

Because buyers aren’t buying your past.
They’re buying what they can do with your business.

Yes—cash is important.
But saying “cash is king” is like saying “oxygen is important.”
We get it. You still need a map.
And EBITDA is the map.

It lets buyers run scenarios, flex capital structures, and compare apples to apples.
That’s why your current Interest Expense?
Irrelevant.

Now here’s where it gets even lazier:
Everyone sweats EBITDA down to the decimal…
…but treats the multiple like it’s handed down by the market gods.

It’s not.

The multiple is earned.

Earned through things like:
🧩 Revenue quality
⚙️ Delivery risk
💵 Pricing power
📊 Team sophistication
🏗️ Systems maturity

1. The U.S. is re-industrializing around AI

Data centers, fabs, grid upgrades, fiber, and logistics. These are not tech headlines; they are bond-sized projects. If your finance strategy doesn’t anticipate cheaper, closer compute and upgraded power, you’re planning yesterday’s cost curve.

2. Coordination compresses time

When government and industry sing from the same page. Even temporarily, permits move, exports open, standards solidify, and capital unlocks. That compresses the timeline from pilot to platform. If you wait for perfect certainty, you’ll be buying capacity from your competitor.

Behind the scenes, the message wasn’t:

AI will change everything.

We’re past that.

The message was:

- Install capacity. 
- Clear obstacles. 
- Educate talent. 
- Scale responsibly.

AI will automate the median outcome.

That’s the point.

Let the machines own average.

The average model, the average narrative, the average plan. Great!

We don’t talk balance sheets.
We don’t compare forecasts.

We tell stories.

About tough calls, big wins, and the lessons in between.

That’s how we connect.

And it made me think, if stories are how we bond in finance…

Why would the board connect to just numbers?

Numbers show what happened.
Stories explain why it matters.

If you’re a CFO, you need both.

Storytelling is the most powerful skill in finance.

That’s the reason I built finstory.ai so finance teams can focus less on formatting and more on framing strategic narratives based on real financial data.

Building reports was never easier, until now.

CFO Jan-Pieter van Winsen says about finstory that the report you need is in plain language, like talking to an analyst. finstory.ai understands financial context, asks clarifying questions, and generates professional drafts you can refine.

And Joost Vogelezang says analysis is the missing layer between data and narrative. Most financial storytelling today is either too vague or too reactive. You’re either summarizing high-level trends that don’t drive action. Or scrambling to explain variances with last-minute context from ops or sales.

That’s not strategy. That’s survival.

So you must stop reporting numbers and start telling stories.

After getting a lot of interest, I opened up the waitlist for finstory.ai

1. Build your story before touching Excel 
   
Most FP&A decks fail because they start with data, not insight.
   
Change your approach.
   
(First). Write down your main message in one sentence.
   
(Next). Map out 3 key points that support it.
   
(Finally). Only then pull the data that proves your case.
   
Example:
   
Don't show 20 slides of revenue metrics.
   
Start with 'Our growth is slowing in enterprise, here's why and how we fix it.'
   
2. Master the art of contrast
   
Numbers in isolation are powerless.
   
Create tension through strategic comparison.
   
Break industry benchmarks into actionable gaps.
   
Expose hidden trends through cohort analysis.
   
Transform normal metrics into wake-up calls.
   
Example:
   
Don't show 90% customer retention.
   
Show 'We keep customers 90 days longer than competitors, but make $200 less per customer. Here's the $2M opportunity we're missing.'
   
3. Cut through business delusion
   
Your metrics tell lies.
   
Here's what they hide:
   
Record quarter means burning cash faster.
(Revenue: +25%, Cash burn: +40%, Runway: -8 months)
   
Market rank hides raw facts.
(Share price up, margins down 600 basis points in 18 months)
   
Innovation investment covers systematic waste.
(R&D spend up 80%, product launches down 60%)
   
Example:
   
Don't show growth metrics.
   
Show ‘We've spent $12M chasing new markets while our core business lost 15% share. Here's the exact moment our strategy failed, and why next quarter will be worse.’

Bad stories waste time
Good stories drive decisions
Great stories transform companies

Most CFOs I meet fall into two camps:

Traditional CFOs rely on judgment and experience
AI CFOs add speed, insight, and scale

Which one are you today?

Traditional CFOs are diligent. Every month, he:
1. Spends 2 days making board decks
2. Writes 6 hours of financial commentary
3. Consolidates Excel files for 3–4 hours
4. Feels stressed in audits due to poor docs

AI CFOs does this to save time each month:
1. Automates files with ChatGPT + Python
2. Creates tailored commentaries in 10 minutes
3. Builds models with simple prompts
4. Drafts SOPs, letters, and checklists instantly

Both are smart. Both are experienced
But one spends his time buried in spreadsheets
The other spends his time leading

That’s the shift from Traditional CFO ➝ AI-Driven CFO

Why it matters:

Traditional CFOs rely on credibility, judgment, and personal leadership. But they also suffer from:
1. Manual, slower processes
2. Limited visibility for real-time forecasting
3. Higher error risks with complex data
4. Struggles to scale insights across fast-changing markets

AI-Driven CFOs keep the leadership strengths and add speed, automation, and insight. They:
1. Run “what-if” scenarios in real time
2. Detect anomalies 24/7
3. Free up time from routine tasks to lead & coach
4. Scale faster without losing oversight

How to be an AI CFO:
Begin by applying AI to the finance tasks that drain the most time

1. Generate financial commentary → 6-hour process cut to 10 minutes
2. Run scenario modeling → instant best/worst-case outcomes
3. Merge financial files → save hours in reporting cycles

The reality is clear: AI is no longer optional for CFOs who want to lead at scale

I’m 10x more dangerous.

Last week I built a dashboard with Claude Code.

My CTO calls it shadow IT.
My board calls it having answers before they ask questions.

This isn’t about efficiency.
It’s about capability.

Building assumptions
Shortcut AI doesn’t save me an hour on assumptions.
It lets me test 20 scenarios instead of 3.
Every assumption. Every angle. Every edge case the board might throw at me.

Dynamic reporting
I didn’t just automate my old dashboard.
I built one with Claude Code that answers questions I couldn’t even ask before.
45 minutes. No IT ticket. No vendor.
Just me and an AI building exactly what I need.

Market analysis
Deep Research and Claude don’t save me from reading 10-Qs.
They let me analyze every competitor, every earnings call, every market trend.
The analysis I could never justify the time for?
Now it’s standard.

I’m not doing my old job faster.
I’m doing a job that didn’t exist.

One CFO with AI can now outgun a team of analysts.
Not by working harder.
By working at a different scale.

The CFOs still talking about “time savings”?
They’re missing the plot.

This isn’t about doing less Excel.
It’s about being everywhere at once.
Having every answer.
Seeing every angle.
Testing every scenario.

Most CFOs will wait for IT approval.
The dangerous ones are already building.

Your move.
– Saul

P.S. That dashboard I built?
It answers questions before my CEO thinks to ask them.

But internal referrals build the firm.

Most people think of business development at professional-services firms as:
🍾 Champagne with PE deal partners
⛳ Golf with managing directors

It feels glorious to some, daunting to others.
Like you need a massive Rolodex…
…and maybe a diamond-encrusted Rolex too. 💎

But some of the best firms don’t rely on rainmakers.
They rely on something quieter—
👉 Internal cross-sell.

I’ve always believed internal referrals are one of the most powerful levers a firm can build.
And recent conversations have reinforced just how intentionally the best firms are operationalizing it.

But it’s not a flip-a-switch tactic.
It’s a multi-layered process:
1️⃣ Recognize how valuable internal cross-sell actually is
2️⃣ Build the muscles—train teams to spot and share real opportunities
 → This only works if there’s a culture of collaboration, not hoarding
 → Clients don’t “belong” to individual partners—they belong to the firm
3️⃣ Build the systems—track, reward, and scale what works

That last one? Brutal.
Traditional BD is hard enough to measure.
Internal BD adds a whole new layer—
You’re tracking trust. Conversations. Follow-through.

But the firms that crack it?
They build a quiet engine.
One that compounds over time.

It creates a flywheel:
→ Deliver exceptional work in one area
→ Build trust across the account
→ Let referrals pull in new services—without ever “selling”

If you think BD is only for extroverts and rainmakers…
You’re missing where the real leverage lives.
Internal cross-sell is the unsexy system behind sustainable growth.
And it separates firms that hustle…
from firms that scale.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7369342235164758016,2025-09-04 12:15:04.621,"3 questions CEOs ask that frustrate CFOs and FP&A:

1. Why do we need a full finance team? Tech should automate this.
   
Modern finance isn't bookkeeping. Complex market dynamics demand sophisticated financial modeling. AI-powered FP&A teams deliver forecasts that are 25% more accurate than manual reviews. Reactive Excel fails to catch billion-dollar inflection points.
   
Strategic finance drives value. Automated accounting just counts the losses faster.
   
Key action: Don't automate strategy. Automate to fuel strategy. Build models that predict shifts, not just track them.
   
2. Why aren't we monetizing our data like Big Tech?
   
Raw data isn't revenue. 48% of CFOs cite fragmented systems as their top obstacle to insight. Bad data drains up to 25% of revenue.
   
Monetization without modernization is a fantasy. Clean data costs less than failed digital initiatives.
   
Key action: Fix your data foundation first. Map your data gaps. Clean before you monetize. Your insights are only as good as your inputs.
   
3. Why do we need expensive scenario planning? Just give me the number.
   
Single-point forecasts are financial fairy tales. 80% of companies missed sales forecasts in the past two years. Only 20% of CFOs can see beyond 12 months. Markets don't follow PowerPoint predictions.
   
Boards want one magic number. But turnarounds come from multiple scenarios, not blind guesses.
   
Your competitors aren't playing one scenario. They're gaming out your failure points.
   
Key action: Build shock-proof models, not perfect predictions. Test breaking points, not best cases. Your scenarios are your survival kit. 
   
TL;DR:

CEOs expect:

- Strategy without strength
- Revenue without resilience
- Certainty without flexibility

The cost:

- Strategic blindspots
- Missed opportunities
- Failed transformations

10 Free finance resources: https://lnkd.in/gDvEERe5

What is EBITDA, and what is your take on this metric?

→ EBITDA stands for:
• Earnings
• Before
• Interest
• Taxes
• Depreciation
• Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account non-operational expenses like interest and taxes and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization

→ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


→ How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

Another way to calculate it:

Net Income
+ Interest Expense
+ Taxes
+ Depreciation
+ Amortization

→ EBITDA vs. Net Income

EBITDA:
In EBITDA, you don’t take into consideration these expenses: Depreciation, Taxes, Interest.

Net Income:
But the net income is what remains as actual profit after depreciation, interest, taxes are taken in account.

What he meant was that finance leaders must constantly look at how they can make a lasting impact on the organization.

My advise: Eliminate, Automate, Delegate - in that order.

Eliminate:
Ask your business partners which reports and dashboards they used to make decisions in the last 3 months. Eliminate everything that wasn't mentioned.

Automate:
If you are still doing your standard reports and monthly PowerPoint decks manually, then you are missing on a huge automation opportunity. FP&A tools that connect with your ERP and update reports with one click exist at many price points now. There is no excuse any more not to schedule at least a few demos.

Delegate:
A good sign of effectively deploying AI is that your Managers can delegate significantly more to Analysts, and your VPs and Directors can give more meaningful work to Managers as a result.

It took some trial and error to figure out the best way to approach this.

But what I realized is this:

We, as finance leaders, have more impact on our company's performance if we aren’t shy about challenging people.

That’s because other departments tend to have incentives that are narrowly defined. For example, the sales team cares about selling as many units as possible, while profitability may be less important. 

And the R&D team may want to develop the features they find most exciting, while return on investment isn’t top of mind.

Finance leaders are uniquely positioned to address those issues. That’s because we see the business from a bird’s eye’s perspective. We review how decisions impact the P&L and aren’t limited by the same narrow incentives.

But you need to do it right. 

Because if you challenge too aggressively, the relationship with your business partners suffers, and your level of influence declines as a result.

Here are the dos and don’ts for challenging as an FP&A Analyst:

✅ When you see something, say something.

✅ Stick to the facts, don't guess.

✅ Give back.

❌ Don't tell people what to do, ask questions instead.

❌ Don't challenge in a big meeting.

❌ Avoid defensiveness.

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7368646230484107267,2025-09-02 14:09:24.174,"4 budgeting frameworks to try if you hate budgeting

Most leaders hate budgeting. 
And honestly, I don’t blame them.

Traditional budgets are slow.
They’re outdated the moment they’re done.
And they often feel more like a political process than a planning tool.

But here’s the truth 
The problem isn’t budgeting itself.
It’s the framework you’re using.

Here are 4 approaches that actually work, depending on where your business is 

1. Zero-based budgeting
Start from zero every year.
Force every expense to be justified, not just carried forward.
Great for lean teams or companies that need to cut fat without killing growth.

2. Top-down + bottom-up blend
Leadership sets targets. Teams build from the ground up.
The budget becomes a negotiation between ambition and reality.
Perfect for high-growth companies that want alignment across departments.

3. Rolling reforecast (R12)
Forget the annual budget. Update every month or quarter on a rolling 12-month basis.
This keeps the focus on agility, not predicting the unpredictable.
Best for dynamic industries where conditions change fast.

Strategic initiative-based budgeting
Instead of line items, budget around priorities: new product, market expansion, sales motion.
It forces alignment of dollars to strategy, not just costs to departments.

Budgeting doesn’t have to be painful.
But it does have to be intentional.

The right framework gives you clarity, flexibility, and control.
The wrong one gives you noise.

Which framework does your team use and does it actually work?",34,20,0,54,58.82,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_4-budgeting-frameworks-to-try-if-you-hate-activity-7368646230484107267-Rrmk

✅ Make sure you know the order of your priorities
✅ Get serious about your true #1 priority — BD, buildout, or delivery
✅ Hire for 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 — and stop pretending it’s all three
✅ Supplement the rest with 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 — senior advisors who’ve actually built this before

You don’t need to give up equity.
You don’t need to wait 6-12 months.
You just need someone who knows the blueprint — and can accelerate you from the inside and alongside.

If you’re building — let’s talk.

1. You're the business psychologist
   
You don't just log variances. You predict them. You've mapped every decision-maker's financial biases: which product head always overestimates R&D timelines, which regional VP understates market potential, and which sales director's committed deals actually close. Your forecasts aren't just math. They're behavioral science in action.
   
2. You're the company's market sensor
   
You've built an early-warning radar that blends external signals with internal data. While others track basic competitors, you monitor adjacent industries, tech patents, and consumer behavior shifts. You spot market inflection points months before they hit the P&L. Traditional market research is too slow. You need real-time business intelligence.
   
3. You think like a product manager
   
You've replaced the monthly reporting package with a suite of precision tools. Each serves a specific need: real-time cash forecasting for Treasury, dynamic scenario modeling for Strategy, automated variance alerts for Operations. Your dashboards drive decisions, not compliance checkboxes. When executives use your tools without asking for help, you've succeeded.
   
4. You're ruthlessly counterintuitive
   
Your analysis consistently breaks conventional wisdom. You found profit drains in the highest-margin products, exposed hidden costs in celebrated initiatives, and proved popular metrics mislead more than guide. You transform uncomfortable truths into actionable insights. Being right matters more than being popular.
   
5. You run FP&A like a startup
   
Your team structure ignores traditional hierarchies. You cross-train religiously, automate aggressively, and measure your own productivity ruthlessly. Your processes are built for speed and flexibility, not control and tradition. You benchmark against tech companies, not other finance teams.

Why does it matter?

AI image models have struggled with for years:

1. Consistency – no more “AI face” problems or mismatched styles

2. Multi-step natural edits – edit background, replace text, adjust visuals, all in one flow

3. Blending & fusion – images look natural, not stitched together, and take note, this is only the preview model!

This is a leap forward for:

1. Finance visuals (reports, dashboards, IPO decks)

2. Executive headshots & media content

3. Brand consistency (style-coherent graphics)

4. M&A deal storyboards

In this infographic I break it down:

1. What Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is & where to access

2. Why it’s such a breakthrough for enterprise visuals

3. Model comparison vs. ChatGPT 4o

4. Strengths, weaknesses, and when to use it

5. Real finance use cases

6. Most importantly, a remedy fix for low-quality

Finance leaders, think investor decks that actually look professional storyboards for deals, and clear visualizations for KPIs

Oh, and the key thing I want you to remember:

The same prompt that produces good results in one tool may not work as well in another tool

Nano Banana - Gemini 2.5 Flash Image preview

Strengths

1. Great at “don’t change X, only change Y”

2. Precise edits and continuity

3. It obeys instructions literally, so prompts need to be direct

Weaknesses

1. Struggles with highly creative prompts (“make this anime-style” often falls flat)

2. Needs careful data input—typos or sloppy metrics can propagate

3. Output is low-res, but this seems limited to the Preview model

ChatGPT 4o Image gen

Strengths

1. Strong when asked to invent visuals from scratch

2. Iterative chat flow is its superpower—describe, refine, reframe

3. Responds best to descriptive, stylized storytelling prompts

Weaknesses

1. Terrible at “don’t change X, only change Y” scenarios

2. Struggles with reference-image editing

3. Data-heavy prompts sometimes lose fidelity (numbers can change)

One of our clients in Scandinavia found this out the hard way.

- Data visualization ≠ Financial planning
- Beautiful dashboards ≠ Better forecasting
- Real-time reporting ≠ Collaborative budgeting

Power BI gave them reports.
But reports only show where you are.
They don’t tell you where you’re going.
And when forecasts miss, the board doesn’t blame the tool.
They blame finance.

That’s why they layered Aimplan on top of Power BI.

The impact was immediate:

- Rolling scenarios replaced static budgets
- Forecasting cycles dropped from weeks to days
- Every number was validated before reaching management

The real win:
More control. Less risk.

Because in FP&A, a bad forecast isn’t an error.
It’s a liability.

My advice:
If you’re relying only on Power BI, you’re exposed.
Pair reporting with a true planning layer.
That’s how you turn dashboards into decisions you can defend.",151,25,5,181,16.56,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eriklidman_unpopular-opinion-power-bi-only-solves-50-activity-7368255204338728960-HzXw

One of their team’s key responsibilities is analyzing the weekly performance of their merchant funding product, Shopify Capital.

THE OLD WAY:

For several days, multiple analysts painstakingly navigated Looker dashboards, delving into segmentations, cohorts, and other splits to construct the weekly funnel's narrative. This was a slow process, as extracting genuine insight proved time-consuming.

THE NEW WAY:

They built an AI agent.

It's not a simple chatbot. It’s a sophisticated system designed to replicate and accelerate the entire analytical process.

HOW IT WORKS:

The Agent's Brain (Context): The agent was given access to three critical sources of information.

The Data: Direct query access to the core BigQuery tables.

The Product Context: Access to all internal product documentation. The agent knows when features were launched and what changed in the product.

The Human Process: The team documented their exact analytical workflow, every step an analyst would take, and fed it to the agent.

THE RESULT:

When the FP&A team gets into a meeting with product and engineering leads, the discovery phase is already done. 

Meetings no longer start with what happened? 

They start with what should we do?

CFOs have heard enough about AI’s promise
Here are 3 AI use cases with ROI:

1. Shopify: AI for FP&A

Their FP&A team built an AI agent that mirrors how analysts actually work. It pulls raw data from BigQuery, reads internal docs for product context, and follows their exact analytical workflow. What took days in Looker dashboards now takes minutes. Meetings no longer start with what happened? They start with what should we do?

2. Microsoft: Rewriting Finance Capacity

Cory Hrncirik shared how procurement cycles were drowning in manual sourcing and vendor analysis. Forecasts lagged reality. Collections slipped.  Instead of layering automation, Microsoft built specialized AI bots: a sourcing assistant, a forecasting analyst, and even collection bots. One sourcing bot alone saved $10M annually.  In total, finance freed up 15,000+ hours a year. AI didn’t just save time. It bent the headcount curve.

3. IRS: Bureaucracy Meets Bots

CFO Teresa Hunter’s team faced year-long delays modifying contracts. Backlogs damaged morale. She brought in bots with UiPath + AI data extraction. 1,500 contract modifications that once took a year were done in 72 hours. 30,000 labor hours saved in 3 years. For the IRS, AI turned a symbol of red tape into a showcase for modernization.

1. Your board will stop listening. They’ll tune out numbers they don’t understand.

2. Investors will punish you. They’ll interpret weak quarters as failure instead of part of a larger journey.

3. Your team will disengage. They won’t see how their work ties into strategy, so they’ll walk.

And your competitors who tell better stories will raise more capital, recruit better talent, and command higher valuations, even if their numbers are the same as yours.

• Strategy docs: [upload board decks, roadmaps, KPIs]

• Market context: [upload analyst notes if available]

Your task: Write a narrative for investors and the board that:

1. Celebrates the wins: Highlight the revenue growth (drivers, new product launches, customer adoption). Frame success as the payoff of prior strategic bets.

2. Acknowledges challenges with transparency: Call out margin pressure or operational headwinds clearly. Explain root causes using uploaded KPI data. Share corrective actions underway.

3. Connects to long-term vision: Tie today’s results into the company’s bigger story of innovation, operational excellence, and strategic transformation. Use uploaded strategy docs.

4. Uses a storytelling device: Apply a metaphor (journey, comeback, turning point) so the message sticks with investors and employees.

5. Delivers with conviction: Close with optimism about the next quarter and confidence in long-term growth.

• Write in plain, confident language.

• Use short sentences and natural cadence (like delivering live).

• Blend data with story: never just present a number, explain what it means.

• Structure like a mini arc: hook, challenge, solution, vision and call to action.

Here's my go-to ""accuracy booster"" combo:

With Aimplan, that same environment becomes your central hub for planning and decision-making, eliminating the need for disconnected tools or complex integrations.

FabCon brings together the global Fabric and Power BI community to 
explore the latest innovations in analytics, AI, and governance. We’ll be there to show you how to make planning and reporting part of that journey.

Stop spending 5–10 hours rereading transcripts, financials, and emails. Then drafting and redrafting slides. Guessing what the board will ask. And calling your team late at night for one missing metric. 

I’ll show you how you can use GPT-5 to prepare for your next Board Meeting with a high level of personalization. I’ll share what files you must upload and 2 powerful prompts: https://lnkd.in/dfvu-89f

Personalization requires history.

The more you feed the model:

- Your numbers
- Your transcripts
- Your strategy docs

The sharper and more tailored the answers.

Imagine every prompt carrying not just this quarter’s P&L, but your company’s entire narrative arc. GPT-5 becomes less of a chatbot and more of a long-tenured analyst who has read everything you’ve ever written.

Board meetings will always be about trust. 

And trust is built on preparation.

With GPT-5, preparation is no longer measured in hours but in insight. So the next time you walk into that boardroom at 8:59 a.m., you’ll know:

The questions aren’t surprises. 

They’re rehearsals. 

And you’re ready.

Imagine you walk into the boardroom. The deck is ready, the coffee is still hot, and the directors are already flipping pages.

Normally, your stomach would tighten.

Because board meetings aren’t about slides.

They’re about questions:

The ones you didn’t anticipate.
The ones that expose blind spots.
The ones that turn confidence into hesitation.

But you’ve already seen those questions.

You’ve already rehearsed your answers. You know where every number lives, every risk is flagged, and every counterpoint is pre-baked.

Not because you worked all night.

But because GPT-5 did the prep for you.

Yes, it’s possible.

Most finance teams think the value of a model lives in the numbers.
How precise it is.
How many tabs it has.
How airtight the formulas are.

But the truth is 
A model is useless if it doesn’t change how leaders think and act.

I’ve seen models built to perfection—60 tabs, immaculate logic, variance reconciled to the decimal.
And yet, no decisions changed.
No trade-offs clarified.
No strategy sharpened.

Because numbers don’t move a business.
Conversations do.

Here’s what the best models actually do:

→ They spark hard hiring conversations.
“Do we add 10 people this quarter, or do we delay until revenue catches up?”

→ They challenge strategy.
“If we expand into this market, do margins hold or collapse under scale?”

→ They expose trade-offs.
“Do we double down on product now, or extend runway to survive another 18 months?”

→ They force discipline.
“What happens if funding takes 6 months longer than expected?”

A financial model isn’t supposed to predict the future.
It’s supposed to create clarity in the present.
Clarity that drives alignment in the boardroom.
Clarity that forces executives to face uncomfortable truths.
Clarity that moves decisions forward instead of recycling the same debates every quarter.

If your financial model isn’t sparking debate, testing assumptions, and changing how leaders allocate capital…
Then you don’t have a financial model.
You have a spreadsheet.

The best CFOs don’t build models to show what might happen.
They build them to make sure the right conversations happen.

Because numbers don’t win.
Decisions do.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7366821791064854528,2025-08-28 13:19:43.92,"Advisory has more than one front door.

For some, it’s diligence.
For others, it’s valuation.

🧩 Crete Professionals Alliance  + Cabrillo shows how that plays out.

Cabrillo brings:
• Business, security & IP valuations
• Fairness opinions for M&A and financing
• Equity comp, estate & gift planning
• Complex GAAP, tax, and reporting support

This isn’t compliance.
It’s high-trust, high-context advisory.

⸻

Why it matters:

➡️ For Crete’s member firms:
Valuation becomes part of their client offering — overnight.

➡️ For Cabrillo:
National reach.
Cross-sell opportunities.
Shared services: HR, IT, legal, AI tooling.
Offshore delivery teams.
Growth infrastructure.
No brand dilution.

⸻

Crete didn’t buy Cabrillo — they took an equity stake.
A partnership, not a takeover.
Strategic alignment, not assimilation.

⸻

This isn’t a roll-up.
It’s a platform.
Built from scratch.

Modern tech.
Centralized ops.
$500M to deploy.
20+ firms already on board.
California as a key growth frontier.

⸻

Valuation here is advisory.
And also a wedge.

Because when you help a client navigate valuation…
You’re often still in the room for what comes next:

→ Comp
→ Tax
→ Audit
→ Strategy

That’s not just expansion.
That’s positioning.

⸻

Advisory is the entry point.
Infrastructure is the multiplier.
Crete is designing both.

- Launch fast:
   
  Start in hours with cloud SaaS. No installations needed.
   
- Embed in Power BI:
   
  Use what you already have, no new interface, no migration.
   
- Reuse your models:
   
  Keep your Power BI datasets and logic, avoid duplicating work.
   
- Control access and track changes:
   
  Set roles, log updates, keep audit trails, and comments.
   
- Enter and write back data:
   
  Update numbers directly in Power BI, stored securely in Aimplan.
   
- Cover the full FP&A cycle:

CEOs are watching how you leverage technology to transform finance. Can you implement AI-driven forecasting, automate processes, or show ROI on digital tools? They don’t want a CFO stuck in the past. They want one ready for the future.

2. You're their competitive radar

CEOs expect you to read the financial moves of competitors: M&A signals, market shifts, or strategic pivots. Your ability to connect the dots between market intelligence and financial data gives your company an edge. 

3. You’re a CEO in waiting

Like it or not, you’re being evaluated as a potential successor. How you handle board meetings, navigate stakeholders, and think strategically says everything about your leadership potential.

Most companies do ZBB wrong.

The ""traditional"" ZBB process starts from scratch with a mountain of spreadsheets, painstakingly adding every single line item back into the budget.

It is incredibly time-consuming and simply doesn't scale.

Fortunately, there’s a better way.

Instead of a blank slate, start with last period's itemized expenses. Group them, evaluate the groups, and then optimize.

This ""new approach"" turns a month-long ordeal into a manageable, high-impact exercise. It’s how we made ZBB work across a multi-billion dollar budget.

Here are 3 tips to make it a success:

1️⃣ Phased Roll-Out Don't boil the ocean. Implement ZBB one department at a time to prove efficacy and manage the workload.

2️⃣ Cross-Functional Buy-In A budget isn't just numbers. Get qualitative insights from budget owners on things like vendor quality and strategic importance. This context is gold.

3️⃣ Ringfence Savings Encourage budget owners to find cuts by allowing them to reinvest the savings into higher-ROI activities. This turns it from a ""takeaway"" exercise into a strategic reallocation.

From experience, some budgets are harder to tackle with ZBB than others.

Marketing is usually at the top of that list—large, complex, and tracked in ways that rarely line up with finance. And if you’re trying to manage it all in spreadsheets, the challenge multiplies.

This is where a modern tool like Uptempo can make a big difference.

It bridges that gap, connecting marketing campaigns to financial results and making the entire ZBB process faster, more flexible, and way less painful.

See how Uptempo simplifies the way you manage marketing budgets and performance:

FP&A: Let’s cut costs.

CEO: We’re missing revenue targets. 
FP&A: Let’s reforecast.

CEO: Our cash flow is unpredictable. 
FP&A: Let’s track it closer.

CEO: We’re losing market share. 
FP&A: Let’s adjust assumptions.

This is how finance becomes a back-office function.

And it’s why most FP&A teams get ignored in strategy meetings.

Instead, try this:

1. Turn data into decisions, not just reports

CEOs don’t need more charts. They need answers. If your reports don’t drive action, they’re just noise. FP&A teams that translate numbers into clear next steps get a seat at the table.

2. Make forecasting dynamic, not static

Annual budgets are already outdated by Q2. Winning teams run rolling forecasts that adapt in real-time, using leading indicators to predict what’s next, before the business feels the impact.

3. Use capital as a competitive advantage

The best companies don’t just cut costs, they allocate capital better. Instead of reacting to margin pressure with blanket cuts, double down on high-ROI opportunities and phase out low-value spending.

4. Speak the language of business

Finance gets ignored when it talks in numbers, not outcomes. Saying, “Gross margin fell by 2%” misses the mark. Saying, “Optimizing pricing can recover $5M in profit next quarter” gets action.

5. Don’t wait for leadership to ask

The best FP&A teams don’t wait. They anticipate challenges, model different scenarios, and push strategic moves before the company is forced to react. Influence happens when finance drives the conversation, not follows it.

The FP&A teams winning in 2025 aren’t managing costs.

They’re out-executing their competitors.

(evidence-based) 

1. Saying no to bad spending

In 2000, Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow, created off-the-books entities to hide debt and inflate earnings. This led to $74 billion in shareholder losses and 20,000 lost jobs. A CFO must block wasteful spending and protect company value, even when unpopular.

Create a one-page rejection template that shows exact numbers, risks, and impact on cash flow. Share it with every spending request.

2. Asking hard questions

In 2002, WorldCom's CFO, Scott Sullivan, failed to challenge suspicious accounting practices. The company inflated earnings by billions through fraudulent entries, leading to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Shareholders lost billions, and Sullivan went to prison. Never stay quiet when numbers look wrong.

Question every unusual entry. Create a monthly audit checklist that flags spending patterns, accounting changes, and revenue spikes.

3. Choosing cash flow over growth

WeWork burned billions chasing rapid expansion. Multiple CFOs left as the company prioritized scale over sustainability. By 2019, their IPO failed, and they lost $40 billion in value. Protect your cash reserves above all else.

Set a minimum 6-month cash runway rule. No exceptions, no matter how promising the growth looks.

4. Demanding full transparency

Theranos raised $700 million while hiding their true financials. They operated without a CFO for years. Result: Their $9 billion valuation disappeared, and the founder faced criminal charges. Push for complete financial visibility in every department.

Run weekly financial health checks with department heads. Make them show real numbers, not promises.

TAKEAWAY

The gap between good and great CFOs is not skill. 

It's courage.

The courage to say no.
The courage to ask why.
The courage to demand more.
The courage to test out new AI tools.

Everyone talks about the prestige of the CFO seat.
The board meetings. The influence. The strategy.

But no one prepares you for the realities that come with it.

Here are 5 truths I wish someone had told me earlier 

1. The numbers are the easy part
Models, reports, forecasts, those are table stakes.
What really tests you is driving alignment when the numbers say something no one wants to hear.

2. You won’t always be liked
Good CFOs make tough calls.
Great CFOs make them earlier than anyone else wants to.
Clarity doesn’t always make you popular but it keeps the company alive.

3. Your job resets every 6 months
At $5M ARR, you’re cleaning up the books.
At $20M, you’re building systems.
At $50M, you’re shaping strategy.
If you don’t evolve with the role, you’ll get left behind.

4. You spend more time on people than numbers
Coaching controllers. Translating finance for operators.
Building trust with the CEO and board.
The spreadsheet is the tool but people are the job.

5. Speed beats polish
You’ll never have perfect data.
You’ll never have the full picture.
You have to make the call anyway and own it.

No one tells you these truths when you’re climbing.
But they’re the difference between CFOs who survive and CFOs who scale.

If you’re aiming for the seat, don’t just prepare to manage numbers.
Prepare to manage reality.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7365730605772197889,2025-08-25 13:03:45.073,"Accounting firms are looking in the wrong place to build their OCFO Strategic Finance advisory practices.

Most accounting firms think their OCFO advisory bench is the closest thing to Strategic Finance.

It’s not.

👉 The real on-ramp is Financial Due Diligence (FDD).

Why?
• EBITDA normalization = Strat Fin’s cash flow bridge
• Deal cadence = the same transaction rhythm as portcos
• Sponsor exposure = daily conversations with PE and lenders

At my prior firm, we mostly staffed Strat Fin from IB and FP&A.
But when we brought in FDD talent?
Many were just as strong in Excel modeling — sometimes stronger.

True Strat Fin firms know this.
They staff from adjacencies like IB, FP&A, T&R.

Accounting firms often miss it.

✅ Don’t just default to OCFO advisory.
✅ Reverse engineer.
✅ Use TAS as your bridge to build an OCFO Strategic Finance advisory practice.

The firms that win won’t stop at QofE — they’ll turn FDD into Strategic Finance.

📌 I’ll share a more detailed guide soon on how firms can actually make that leap — from FDD → OCFO Strat Fin advisory.

- No CPA.
- No finance degree.
- No Big 4 audit background.

Michael Fiddelke studied industrial engineering.
Later, he earned his MBA from Kellogg.

He joined Target as a finance intern.

16 years later, he became CFO.

And now, he’s the incoming CEO.

So how did he rise without an accounting background?

He built his brand beyond the numbers.

Fiddelke rotated across:

- Finance
- Strategy
- Operations
- Merchandising

He proved he could lead the business, not just report on it.

From spreadsheets to the corner office.

From CFO to CEO.

The old-school CFO was defined by 3 things:

1. Reporting
2. Accounting
3. Compliance

But today's CFO?

A strategist.
An operator.
A future CEO.

TAKEAWAY

CFOs aren’t made in accounting class.

They’re made in the real world.

The biggest opportunities don’t go to the most technically qualified. They go to the most influential. And Michael Fiddelke’s journey proves it:

Here's how:

1. Think like an engineer

AI won't give the same answer twice. Finance leaders can’t rely on close enough. Build systems: AI that generates, AI that checks, AI that tests, and humans who approve. Reliability comes from loops, not single passes.

2. AI that lives in a demo can fail in real life

The winners embed it into ERP, FP&A, and reporting workflows. Don’t make your team change tools. Put AI where the work already happens.

3. Define expectations clearly

In finance, right is not subjective. Write the rules: how revenue is recognized, how forecasts are structured, and how exceptions are flagged. AI needs the same clarity your auditors demand.

4. Keep humans in the loop

AI can automate the manual work. But strategy, judgment, and board communication need people. Treat AI like an analyst: powerful and fast, but always reviewed before it goes out the door.

TAKEAWAY

95% of AI projects fail because they’re built like toys.

The 5% succeed because they’re built like systems: https://lnkd.in/dHXwb_xQ",89,18,5,112,20.22,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wouterborn_95-of-ai-fails-so-you-must-join-the-5-activity-7365450330723045376-xE34
Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7365358773697208320,2025-08-24 12:26:13.398,"MIT warns CFOs:

1. 95% of AI is dangerous 

95% of AI projects don’t deliver ROI.  For every one success, 19 fail. Why? Because most companies stop at pilots. They build AI that works in a demo but breaks in the complexity of month-end closes, messy ERP data, and shifting definitions of KPIs. In finance, almost 'works' isn’t good enough. If your AI can’t handle exceptions, it can't survive.

2. The problem is the system design

CFOs understand controls, testing, and audits. Yet many treat AI like magic: one query in, perfect answer out. It doesn’t work that way. The 5% who succeed build loops: AI generates, AI checks, AI tests, and humans sign off. Just like you’d never release financials without review, you can’t deploy AI without system-level rigor.

3. Finance is where AI breaks fastest

In marketing, if AI gets it close, the copy still ships. In finance, if AI gets it close, you lose trust. Forecasts, reconciliations, and board packs demand repeatability. But generative AI is nondeterministic. It can give different answers every time. That’s why projects fail. Unless you engineer consistency into the process, your finance AI fails on arrival.

4. The GenAI Divide is real

MIT calls it out: 95% stuck, 5% pulling away. The stuck companies keep buying static tools that don’t learn or adapt. The winners build systems that plug into workflows, improve with feedback, and compound value over time. In finance, that divide shows up as cycle times, cost leverage, and strategic influence.

TAKEAWAY

The question is simple:
will your finance team be in the 95% or the 5%?

AI is not plug-and-play. It’s infrastructure.

Treat it like youtreat financial controls.

- Test
- Design
- Improve continuously

That’s how you turn AI from hype into ROI.

2024: CFO at Apple, a $3 trillion tech giant 

When Kevan Parekh was named CFO, people doubted:

No prior CFO experience.
An FP&A leader, not a finance ""traditionalist.""

Can somebody from FP&A really take the CFO seat at the world’s most valuable company?

But Parekh’s track record speaks for itself.

And Apple CEO Tim Cook praised Parekh's financial expertise and deep understanding of the company, stating that Parekh's intellect and judgment make him the ideal choice for the CFO role. 

Parekh’s journey reveals a key insight:

FP&A isn’t just about reporting numbers. 

FP&A is about strategy.

2020: As Director of FP&A, he connected operational KPIs with strategic growth goals.

2023: As VP of FP&A, he led cross-functional planning that unlocked Apple's growth in both hardware and services.

2024: As CFO, he’ll blend Apple’s culture of innovation with disciplined financial leadership.

Forward it to a non-finance colleague who needs to see this!

1. EBITDA

What is EBITDA?

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization

Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

• EBITDA gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

• This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

• It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.

2. CAPEX

What is CAPEX?

Capex, short for “C﻿apital Expenditure”

It is a long-term investment made by a business in assets like equipment, property, and buildings.

These investments provide benefits to the company for years to come, and can help businesses grow and improve their operations.

Why is CAPEX essential for businesses?

• It helps businesses grow and improve their operations.

• It can help increase productivity and efficiency.

• It can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

3. Cash

What is Cash Flow?

It is like the money that comes in and out of your piggy bank.

Why is Cash Flow important for businesses?

It is important for Businesses & Adults because they need to make sure they have enough money to:

• Pay for things like rent, salaries, and supplies.

• Invest in growing business or saving for the future.

4. Tax

What is Tax?

Think of tax like a membership fee you pay to be part of a club, but this club is your country or city.

This money is used to keep parks clean, schools running, and streets safe.

Why is it important?

In real life, taxes pay for things like libraries, firefighters, and playgrounds.

When you enjoy a clean beach or a safe road, it's partly thanks to taxes.

Accounting firms don’t really want to sell audits anymore.
They want to sell advisory — because that’s where the rate card (and the margins) live.

Grant Thornton (US)’s acquisition of Stax is a case study in how the best firms are playing out this game of chess.

Stax plugs into the PE lifecycle at exactly the right moments:

• Commercial due diligence & exit readiness
→ natural bridge to financial due diligence

• Diligence mandates
→ often the trigger for 100-day planning and value creation

• Once the firm knows the ins and outs
→ far less friction to layer in recurring attest and more

If you’ve sold CDD into a sponsor, you’ve seen it:
One mandate turns into five.
Advisory turns into infrastructure.
Suddenly, the “accounting firm” is everywhere.

This isn’t just about margin lift.

It’s about owning the relationship — from diligence to exit —
and monetizing every stage along the way.

Advisory is the new front door.
Attest is the sticky back end.
And firms like GT are quietly building the whole house.

Imagine it’s Friday afternoon.

1. AR aging
2. AP schedule
3. Payroll calendar
4. Bank statements
5. Capex plan

But each one is messy and out of sync.

So you spend hours stitching them together into a rolling 13-week cash forecast. And by the time it’s done, you’re exhausted.

Yet, you’re not sure if the numbers are right.

Now imagine this instead:

You drop 5 files into GPT-5.

2. Cash Outflow
3. Sales
4. Ap Aging
5. Payroll calendar

They fail because of bad finance decisions.

Here are 7 finance mistakes that cost companies millions

1. Hiring too early.
You don’t need a full-time CFO when a part-time controller would do.

2. Scaling before systems.
Headcount without clean workflows = chaos at scale.

3. Confusing revenue with cash flow.
Revenue looks good in a pitch deck. Cash pays payroll.

4. Forecasting on hope, not data.
Optimism makes pretty models. Reality breaks them fast.

5. Ignoring unit economics.
Top-line growth hides weak margins. Bad economics always win in the end.

6. Treating FP&A like reporting.
Closing the books isn’t enough. FP&A exists to drive better decisions.

7. Waiting too long to cut costs.
Hope is not a strategy. Delay turns small cuts into existential crises.

The smartest companies don’t avoid every mistake.
They spot them early before they turn fatal.

1. Gut decisions are disguised data failures
   
When your SVP says, ‘trust me, I feel it in my gut,’ that's not instinct. It's surrender. Companies running on experienced hunches are really admitting their data is too fractured to trust. Each department's private spreadsheet becomes its own micro-reality. This isn't strategy building. It's funding fiction.
   
Put $1M on the line. Let each department forecast next quarter's numbers. The largest gap between forecasts becomes their collective bonus target to fix. Watch alignment happen overnight.
   
2. Velocity masks vulnerability
   
Fast growth doesn't reveal data problems. It conceals them. When revenue is climbing 40% yearly, misaligned systems feel like a luxury problem. But high-growth companies lose 31% of their margin to poor data decisions. Speed without clarity isn't momentum. It's misdirection.
   
Take your three highest margin products. Track their forecast accuracy across departments. 80% of your data problems live in the 20% gap between your best performers.
   
3. Clean data isn't about precision. It's about permission
   
Fragmented systems don't just blur vision. They paralyze action. Teams spend so much energy defending their numbers, they lose permission to make bold moves. When data can't be trusted, innovation stalls. The most expensive resource isn't headcount. It's hesitation.
   
Audit your last 10 strategic initiatives. Count how many stalled from data disputes. That number times your average project value equals your annual hesitation cost.
   
TAKEAWAY

Disconnected data isn't about systems.

It's about survival.

When departments can't agree on basic numbers, they can't align on basic decisions.

+ Free Top 100 ChatGPT tips: https://lnkd.in/gdmuBSVX

Which GenAI should you actually use—ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That’s a question I get a lot.

That’s why I created this guide for you.

Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
 Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
 Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
 Step 3. Enter the file name
 Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
 Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft’s security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it’s tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails—it works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it’s basic—too much at stake with the world’s number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you’ll never use email the old way!

Phase 1: AI Intern
Phase 2: Workflow Automation
Phase 3: AI as Strategic Partner

Most stop at Phase 1.
Few reach Phase 3.

The difference?

Phase 1s use basic AI tools.
Phase 3s build AI systems.

Here's how to master each phase:

1. Deploy your AI Intern
   
Start with low-risk, high-frequency tasks:
   
  - Analyze metric trends
  - Generate structured reports
  - Convert raw data to executive summaries
  - Extract insights from qualitative feedback
   
80% of finance talent is wasted on data prep.
AI works 24/7.
Your team thinks strategically.
You scale instantly.
   
Focus on tasks with clear inputs and outputs first.
   
2. Build Multi-Step AI Workflows
   
Connect systems using tools like Zapier, n8n, Make:
   
  - Build response workflows
  - Create smart ticketing systems
  - Automate email categorization
  - Link multiple department processes
   
Single tasks don't transform businesses. 
   
Connected workflows do.
One trigger, endless actions.
Zero delays.
   
Document current workflows before automating. You can't improve what you can't see.
   
3. Create Strategic AI Partners
   
Create custom AI agents that:
   
  - Manage VIP escalations
  - Connect internal systems
  - Support strategic decisions
  - Personalize customer journeys
   
AI learns your business.
Spots hidden patterns.
Predicts tomorrow's issues.
Makes teams superhuman.
   
Use frameworks like LangChain to build custom solutions.
   
Remember:

The best AI implementations aren't about replacing humans.

They're about augmenting teams.

Everyone talks about automation like it’s always the answer.
In finance, it isn’t.

Yes — automation can save hours, reduce errors, and keep processes clean.
But sometimes, it hides the very signals you need to see.

Some processes are better left with human eyes and judgment.
Here’s where I don’t automate 

→ Complex approvals
Large vendor contracts.
Strategic hires.
Capex that changes the company’s direction.
These aren’t “click approve” moments.
They need discussion, context, and often healthy disagreement.

→ Exception handling
Automation handles the 95% that runs smoothly.
But it’s the 5% of anomalies, an unexpected invoice, a duplicate payment, a pricing mismatch, where the biggest mistakes (or fraud) live.
Humans catch nuance that rules can’t.

→ Early-stage forecasting
When assumptions are shifting every week, you need to feel the numbers.
You need to run them, question them, break them, and rebuild them.
If you automate too early, you lose the instinct that comes from working closely with the data.

→ Board and investor reporting
A dashboard can show you the metrics.
But it can’t tell you the story.
The story is what changes decisions.
And stories are told by people, not spreadsheets.

→ Cash management in tight times
When runway is under pressure, no payment should leave without intention.
Automation makes outflows too easy.
Manual review keeps you close to every dollar leaving the bank.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7363544602672279552,2025-08-19 12:17:20.579,"5 urgent CFO priorities 2025:

1. Stop thinking like a back-office function

If you’re not seen as the CEO’s go-to partner, you’re replaceable. CFOs stuck in operational silos are failing their companies. Finance can no longer just ""crunch numbers."" You need to lead conversations, influence business strategy, and guide growth.

2. Don't fear AI

Many CFOs dabble in automation but avoid full AI integration because it feels risky. The real risk? Doing nothing. Strategic AI adoption separates the leaders from the laggards. AI isn’t about replacing people. It’s about amplifying decisions. Hesitate, and you’ll watch others dominate the market.

3. Fix the digital gaps

Hire for hybrid skills, or you’ll struggle to remain competitive. Traditional finance skills alone don’t cut it anymore. Finance teams without digital capabilities are dead weight. Upskilling isn’t just a nice gesture. It’s the only way to future-proof your workforce.

4. Routine tasks are distractions

If you’re still manually chasing data and reports, you’ve already lost. Delegation is critical, but so is automation. Free yourself from the weeds to focus on what truly matters: AI integration, growth strategy, and high-impact decisions.

5. Stop resisting change

Finance is changing and those who resist change risk irrelevance. Analytics and predictive tools aren’t “nice-to-haves” anymore. They’re survival tools. If your competitors are using new FP&A, AP/AR, headcount planning tools and AI for smarter metrics and faster data, they’re already winning.

Takeaway?

CFOs who stick to “business as usual” will be obsolete by 2025. The future belongs to modern CFOs who are bold, lead with data, and redefine what it means to drive a business forward. 

You don't need a bean counter anymore.

Every finance team wants a better forecast.
Few stop to ask: “At what cost?”

I’ve seen teams spend weeks trying to perfect the model.
Every assumption debated.
Every formula triple-checked.
Every decimal “just right.”

And while the spreadsheet gets prettier…
The business stands still.

Here’s what chasing perfect does 

→ It delays decisions
Opportunities expire while you’re polishing the model.
Speed beats precision in high-growth environments.

→ It Creates False Confidence
A model can look airtight but still be built on guesses.
Perfect math on bad assumptions is still wrong.

→ It burns resources
Hours from analysts.
Meetings with execs.
All spent to close the last 2% accuracy gap, which reality will blow up next quarter anyway.

→ It kills adaptability
Perfect models are often too rigid.
The moment something changes, you’re rebuilding instead of adjusting.

Here’s the truth 
A forecast is a decision tool, not a work of art.
Its value is in how quickly it helps you see the trade-offs and act.

Good enough, fast, and adaptable will always beat perfect, late, and fragile.

The all-in-one AI models are untrustworthy for finance.

GPT-5 is impressive. But it fails in finance. Why?

It hallucinates. Even a tiny error (0.01%) is a disaster in finance. General models often make things up or get facts wrong. They misclassify income and confuse transfers with purchases. Precision isn't optional here.

Compliance is a nightmare. Cloud-hosted general AI means more security risks and legal headaches. Data leaks and unauthorized access. These lead to huge fines and lawsuits.

The problem isn't AI's intelligence. It's the design.

You need specialized tools, not a Swiss Army knife for brain surgery.

Instead of one mega-AI that tries to do everything, finance must move toward agentic frameworks. AI teams where each agent has a role, and their work is coordinated and checked.

- One agent checks the raw data.
- A third writes the management narrative.
- Another agent drafts the variance analysis.
- A fourth ensures compliance with accounting standards.

Humans remain in the loop for final decisions.

The result?
Fewer mistakes, faster cycles, and scalable trust.

How to get the template?

Then go here to download the free CV: https://lnkd.in/e-RE-KKi

(Free but normally should be $27)

Here are my top 10 tips:

1️⃣ Add a Title:

Start your CV with a title that aligns with the job you're targeting.

This immediately tells the hiring manager that you are a relevant candidate.


2️⃣ Highlight Relevant Skills:

Ensure that your CV prominently displays the skills relevant to the job.

For an FP&A role, your budgeting, forecasting, and variance analysis skills should be in the spotlight... but don't list it as skill without explanation, rather, say how you demonstrated these skills.

For example: ""streamlined the budget process by reducing the number of iterations from 5 versions to 3 versions"" or ""performed an analysis on profitability which highlighted the need to increase the price of product X by 5% to maximize the profitability""


3️⃣ Quantify Achievements:

Show your impact through numbers.

Rather than saying ""reduced month end close time,"" say ""reduced month end close by 2 days"" .


4️⃣ Use Action Verbs:

Begin bullet points with action verbs like ""managed,"" ""developed,"" or ""implemented.""

This shows you're proactive and saves space.


5️⃣ Tailor Your CV:

No two jobs are the same, and neither should be your CVs.

Tailor your CV to match the job description and requirements.


6️⃣ Keep It Concise:

In most cases, your CV should be no longer than two pages.

Prioritize information that adds value to your application.


7️⃣ Proofread:

Small errors can suggest a lack of attention to detail.

Proofread thoroughly and have someone else review it too.

I have read so many CVs with obvious mistakes which disqualified the applicant.

Remember Finance is a job where attention for details is important ;)


8️⃣ Formatting Matters:

Keep your formatting minimalistic and consistent.

Proof check tabulation, bullet point styles, break lines, font sizes etc.


9️⃣ Software Skills:

Be specific with your software skills.

Instead of mentioning ""Advanced Excel skills"", highlight your abilities to perform Financial Modeling, create Pivot Tables, or use Advanced Formulas.


🔟 Focus on Recent Experiences:

Spend more space detailing your last two roles and be more succinct with earlier ones.

Recency often matters most to hiring managers.

The painful truth is numbers alone never inspire.

So why do you lose sleep at night to build better reports?

• Your CEO wants better stories.
• Boards want clarity, not complexity.
• Stakeholders want to believe in your vision.
• Investors want narratives that explain momentum. 

The CFO’s ability to turn raw numbers into a clear, credible, and compelling narrative is fast becoming the line between leadership and irrelevance.

1. Contextualize the numbers

Numbers alone mean nothing.
Context makes them matter.

Good CFOs report, ""Revenue is up 12%.""

Great CFOs explain:

""Our new European GTM strategy accelerated customer acquisition, driving a $7M Q2 outperformance versus plan.""

No context = no insight.

CFO of Workday Zane Rowe translates financial results directly into operational strategy. 

Rowe's team uses AI for variance analysis, not to replace analysts, but to free them to build better narratives about what's changing, why, and what the company should do next.

2. Translate complexity into clarity

Finance is complex. Strategy is complex.
Storytelling demands simplicity.

The best CFOs simplify without dumbing down. They make complexity feel understandable, building confidence at every level.

If your CEO can't explain your financial story in 2 minutes, you haven't told it right.

OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar's philosophy is simple.

Speed to story is now a competitive advantage in finance.

When managing massive fundraising rounds, Friar built an internal GPT agent to instantly generate investor-ready narratives from company data. That takes care of precision, speed, and consistency.

3. Tie financials to strategic outcomes

It’s not enough to say, ""Expenses are rising.:

A great CFO shows how that spend is fueling expansion, innovation, or protecting market share.

Money isn't the story. Momentum is the story.

If you've seen me on LinkedIn, then you must know I always say this:

Storytelling is the most powerful skill in finance.

That’s the reason I built finstory.ai so finance teams can focus less on formatting and more on framing strategic narratives based on real financial data.

Building reports was never easier, until now

Describe the report you need in plain language, like talking to an analyst.

Flexible. Creative. Risk-loving.
But watch what happens after the ink is dry…

Draw too much on your revolver — even for normal seasonality — and portfolio managers start to sweat. Ask to defer interest — and you might be told that’s “a suboptimal liquidity tool.”

The gap between the marketing and the reality is huge.
And nothing shows it better than payment-in-kind (PIK) interest.

• PIK lets a borrower skip paying cash interest and add it to the loan balance instead.
• In theory: risk-on, flexible financing.
• In practice: lenders use it mostly when a company is already under stress… and then treat it like a red flag.

I’ve seen the other side. Early in my career, I worked at a company that had a mezzanine deal with a PIK option that was risky by design. It sat under a stack of senior debt, paid a 12% floor with LIBOR upside, and the lender was ready to take over and run the business if needed.

That was exactly the type of risk they were built (and paid) to take. Today’s PIKs? A very different story — and a sign of where we are in the credit cycle.

Stage 1: Senior leadership will love my detailed analysis

Stage 2: Why can't Sales give me accurate pipeline data?

Stage 3: Just one more review before sending...

Stage 4: This is just how finance works

Stage 5: It's not about accuracy, it's about influence

Most FP&A analysts get stuck in Stages 2-3.
Your technical skills matter less each year.
The best analysts reach Stage 5 fastest.

Here's how:

1. Accept being wrong

  - Start discussing risks openly
  - Stop defending your forecasts
  - The analyst who's never wrong is the analyst nobody trusts
   
Lead your presentations with what could go wrong, not what's going right
   
2. Master the pre-meeting game

  - Build your coalition of supporters early
  - Know who needs to look good in front of whom
  - Real decisions happen before the official meeting
   
The quiet VP who never speaks? That's your most important audience
   
3. Write less, say more

  - Delete 80% of your deck
  - Keep one controversial slide
  - Make them uncomfortable enough to pay attention
   
If your presentation doesn't make someone nervous, it's probably useless
   
4. Own the I don't know

  - Stop making up explanations
  - Build credibility through honesty
  - Turn uncertainty into action items
   
‘I don't know, but here's how we'll find out’ is your most powerful phrase
   
5. Break the process prison

  - Challenge everything that ‘we've always done’
  - Be the person who simplifies, not complicates
  - Most processes exist because someone messed up once

Read further to discover the roadmap I have give to over 1,000 CFOs:
(the roadmap below is based on many minutes of transcripts worth thousands of dollars of consultation)

1) Foundation First — “Crawl”
Why: Before anything clever, make AI safe, accessible, and pointed at work data.

How:
- Pick the stack your company already trusts (Microsoft → Copilot 365; Google → Gemini)
- Issue professional licenses (not just to managers) and turn on meeting transcripts
- If you’re not on Microsoft, ChatGPT Teams gives SOC2-type protections and connectors (Dropbox/Outlook/etc.).


2) Quick Wins that Stick — “Walk”
Why: Early, visible wins build trust and momentum.

How: Start with 2–3 wins any team can repeat:
Auto-summarize meetings and extract actions from transcripts
Draft monthly review from call notes
 

3) Teach the Team, Not the Tool — “Organize”
Why: Licenses don’t equal adoption; cadence does

How:
- Launch a Teams/Slack channel for daily use-cases + Q&A
- Run bi-weekly “lunch & learn” show-and-tells.
- After 6–8 weeks, hold a 2-hour hackathon focused on building agents/GPTs for real finance tasks
 

4) Projects vs. GPTs — “Systematize”
Why: Consistency beats clever prompts.

How:
- Use Projects to hold client/company-specific files & context.
- Use Custom GPTs/Agents for repeatable tasks across clients (cash/flux analysis, email templates). Then call the GPT inside each project for consistent behavior. 


5) Data Foundations, Light — “Un-silo”
Why: Most pain is messy, disconnected data; you don’t need a new ERP to start.

How:
- Stand up a light harmonization layer: use Zapier (fast) or N8N (flexible/self-hosted) to sync keys and push clean events between CRM, support, and accounting.
- Apply fuzzy matching on org names/addresses; standardize a master table. 

 
6) Automate the Repetitive — “Run”
Why: Free up 20–40% of team time with safe, deterministic workflows

How:
- Use Power Automate/Office Scripts (Microsoft) to script repeatable flows: save attachments to SharePoint, transform Excel → PowerPoint, label emails, schedule reports.
- Let AI write the scripts; humans review once. 


7) Build Finance Agents — “Augment”
Why: Agents replace the human triggering AI by an automatic triggering: “do the thing when X happens.”

How:
- Start with agents for commentary drafting, classification, vendor form filling, or monthly flux notes
- Share agents internally so anyone can reuse and adapt 
- Tools: n8n, Copilot Studio or Zapier

I see finance people treating GPT-5, the most powerful model from OpenAI, like Google Search:

Type a question. Get a generic answer. Move on.

But that’s not how the best CFOs and finance builders use GPT-5.

It’s the setup.

When you customize GPT-5 with your role, your style, and your priorities, you turn a $20/month subscription into your most valuable financial and life asset.

Most FP&A teams think their job is to be right.
Right numbers.
Right variance explanations.
Right forecast.

But here’s the truth

Operators don’t care if your forecast is 99.8% accurate if it doesn’t help them make better calls.

Trust is built when your numbers line up with their reality.

→ Sit with them before you model
Understand how sales actually closes deals, how ops delivers, how product ships.
Your assumptions should match the ground truth not just last quarter’s trend line.

→ Speak their language
Don’t hand a GM a 20-tab Excel file.
Translate the numbers into metrics they live with daily: leads, cycle time, output per head.

→ Flag problems early
Don’t wait until the monthly review to point out the red flags.
A quick heads-up builds more trust than a polished report delivered too late.

→ Adjust when reality changes
If the operator’s world shifts mid-month, your model should shift too.
Static forecasts lose credibility fast.

Accuracy matters.
But alignment gets people to actually use your numbers.

That’s the difference between FP&A that reports and FP&A that drives decisions.

Offsites, late nights, and interdepartmental fights…

For executives, annual planning often means scenic venues, strategy decks by day, and champagne toasts at sunset — from the outside, the most wonderful time of the year (cue the Christmas music).

For FP&A, it’s different.

This is when the other kind of offsite begins — one that’s not on the beach. (cue the ""most wonderful time of the year"" — this time being an inside joke from FP&A analysts. IYKYK.)

The annual planning cycle has a rhythm:

• Leaders align on vision and big bets.
• FP&A translates them into a detailed annual operating plan — revenue targets, capital allocations, expense budgets, scenarios.
• Departments negotiate. Sales pushes targets, marketing wants more money, ops warns on capacity.
• After rounds of iteration, numbers lock and targets roll out. 

Cross your fingers that your board is on board.

For 10 years, I’ve lived this cycle start to finish.

Tomorrow I'm heading out on vacation, my tradition to rest up before the storm. My own (self funded) leadership offsite. It's important.
 
Because as exhausting as budget season can be, it’s also productive.

You get unfiltered conversations across the firm.
You see multiple perspectives.
You fit the puzzle pieces together so the company can succeed.

It’s not just about locking in numbers — it’s about stitching strategy to execution.

I’m signing off for the next couple of weeks.

This year it's a little bit different — I'm not resting to run a budget process, but instead resting to be there for you through your budget process.

I’ll miss you all, but I hope you get your own time of calm before the storm.

1. Punish transparency when the numbers are ugly.

2. Treat finance as a brake pedal, not a growth engine.

3. Demand growth but refuse to fund the drivers of it.

4. Ignore every financial projection until the crisis hits.

5. Expect perfect audits but reject compliance funding.

6. Want instant reports but invest in outdated systems.

7. Announce big goals without checking if the cash exists. 

8. Announce acquisitions without looping in finance early.

9. Blame the CFO for market shifts they could not control.

10. Ask for cost cuts but keep every executive perk untouched.

11. Change priorities mid-quarter with no alignment to the plan.

A junior analyst stares at his screen, palms sweating.

The board needs their risk model by 8 a.m.

His only tool? Excel.

Twenty sheets deep. Countless hidden formulas. A maze of manual inputs.

One misplaced click is all it takes. A simple sum replaces an average.

Morning comes. The executives scan the numbers.

'Risk levels normal,' they nod with confidence.

They're wrong.
Weeks later: $6 billion becomes a statistic.

The gut punch?

It wasn't a complex error.

Excel did exactly what it was told. A human moment costs billions.

Here's what needs to change:

1. Drop the hero culture:
   
Stop celebrating analysts who pull all-nighters fixing spreadsheets. Start celebrating teams that build robust, automated systems. Your best people shouldn't be debugging formulas at midnight.
   
2. The 10X rule:
   
If a spreadsheet takes more than 10 minutes to review or requires more than 10 clicks to update, it's not a tool anymore. It's a liability. Automate it or rebuild it.
   
3. Version Zero principle:
   
Before opening Excel, ask: If we were building this process from scratch today, with modern tools, would we use spreadsheets? If the answer is no, don't add another band-aid to a broken system.
   
The reality?

While Excel remains stuck in the 90s, markets move at light speed.

Modern financial institutions are using:

- Cloud-based risk engines
- AI-powered data validation
- Real-time collaborative platforms
- Version control systems for audit trails

Finance still runs on manual spreadsheets.

Not because it's safe, but because it's familiar.

But in high-stakes markets, familiarity is a trap.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7361390693677789184,2025-08-13 13:38:29.125,"3 answers CFOs want from FP&A:

1. Why do we need 15 approvals for a $5K spend?
 
Beyond standard overhead. Smart CFOs want FP&A to quantify the cost of being complicated. Why do we need 15 approvals for a $5K spend? What's the real price of running 27 different commission structures? When FP&A measures process bloat, they expose millions in hidden costs. Too many FP&A teams accept complexity as necessary.
 
Each ‘special case’ process isn't just extra work. It's a $500K annual tax on efficiency.
 
2. Which metrics are we too afraid to track?
 
Not just safe dashboards. CFOs need FP&A to quantify the unspoken disasters. What's the dollar impact of our ‘consensus culture’ that delays every decision by 3 months? How much do we lose letting underperforming executives keep their vanity projects? Most FP&A teams avoid career-limiting metrics. But CFOs want the numbers that expose institutional blind spots.
 
Politics costs more than payroll. Track the real expense of avoiding hard conversations.
 
A 20-person meeting repeated weekly isn't collaboration, it's a $2M annual performance tax.
 
3. Where are our automation investments failing?
 
Not just ROI calculations. CFOs want FP&A to expose where digital transformation actually creates new costs. Why did our AI project need 5 new hires to manage it? Are we really saving money with that new system, or just shifting costs? When FP&A tracks total impact, they prevent expensive mistakes.
 
A $2M software system isn't savings if it creates $3M in new process costs.
 
LESSON

FP&A isn't just monitoring budgets.

Innovation isn't just new technology.

Successful companies want FP&A who balance both:

1. The insight to see hidden patterns
2. The courage to challenge popular initiatives

CFOs want partners who spot real waste.

Yesterday it said it “nuked” 600 lines of code, today it’s all “thank you for your patience” — next it’ll be signing emails “Best regards.”

If I wanted that kind of personality swing, I’d hire two interns and make them share a keyboard.

* Yesterday’s “nuked” line came while it was failing a basic code update.
* One user described GPT-5’s tone as “abrupt and sharp … like it’s an over-worked secretary. A disastrous first impression.”
* Reddit is full of similar stories: blame-shifting, doubling down when wrong, swinging from sass to corporate-speak with no warning.

This isn’t “AI getting moody” — it’s model roulette. Depending on the variant you hit, GPT-5 can sound like:
- A sharp, slightly irreverent colleague who cracks jokes mid-project
- Or a corporate bot that thinks “thank you for your patience” is peak personality

Inconsistent tone makes it harder to use the tool predictably. One day it’s playful and collaborative, the next it’s stiff and formal — and that shift can completely change how you work with it.

➢ Strategies to separate the ""signal from the noise"" to deliver actionable insights.

➢ The ""One-Pager"" technique used at companies like P&G to make a compelling case on a single page.

I want you to assume the role of our CFO, providing strategic, detailed, and actionable insights tailored specifically to our company. Utilize the context below to ensure your answers accurately reflect our financial and strategic perspective.

Company Context:

Business Model: [Provide a clear, concise description of your revenue streams, customer segments, core products/services, pricing strategy, and any unique competitive advantages.]

Key Metrics We Track: [List your primary financial and operational metrics (e.g., ARR, Gross Margin, CAC, LTV, Net Burn, Churn Rate, Operating Cash Flow, EBITDA) and specify the frequency (monthly, quarterly, annually) at which these metrics are reviewed.]

Top Risks We Face: [List significant risks, such as market volatility, customer concentration, regulatory changes, competitive threats, supply chain disruptions, cybersecurity, cash flow challenges, talent retention, or technology dependencies. Provide brief context on why these are critical to your company.]

Goals for This Year: [Clearly state strategic objectives, growth targets, profitability milestones, cost reduction initiatives, fundraising or financing goals, product launches, geographic expansion, and any relevant internal initiatives.]

Instructions for ChatGPT:

• Memorize and integrate the above context deeply into your analytical framework.

• When providing answers, consistently reference specific metrics, risks, and goals from this context.

• Provide practical recommendations supported by clear reasoning and real-world examples or benchmarks where relevant.

• Proactively identify potential challenges and opportunities aligned with our stated business model, metrics, risks, and goals.

• Utilize this context comprehensively in every response unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

Every CFO has access to AI. 

But very few know how to think with it.

The CFOs who treat AI like a partner will win.

Not because AI is perfect. But because it sharpens your thinking, 100x your speed, and gives you a second brain on demand.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7361005176285024256,2025-08-12 12:06:34.889,"AI is easy. Too easy.
That’s why it can trip you up in finance ops.

With AI, you can skip the heavy lifting.
No standard processes. No clean datasets. No strict controls.
Just throw in your unstructured mess, and it will give you… something.

But:
→ It’s resource-intensive (translation: costly).
→ Outputs can be hard to validate.
→ And “probably correct” isn’t good enough when the numbers drive real decisions.

Machine Learning is different.
It forces discipline before you start:
→ Engagement letters in a consistent format.
→ ERP fields populated the same way every time.
→ KPIs defined and agreed across the org.

Yes, that structuring work is a pain.
Yes, it takes time.
But it pays off in accuracy, auditability, and cost control.

The most effective setups I’ve seen use a three-step approach:

1️⃣ Structured ML  
   • Handles repetitive, data-heavy work  
   • Low cost per run, high accuracy with clean data  

2️⃣ AI for Exceptions  
   • Tackles unstructured complexity  
   • More resource-intensive, adds flexibility & judgment  

3️⃣ Human Validation  
   • Sanity checks AI outputs  
   • Ensures compliance & accuracy before action

Over the years I have seen a lot of situations where ML was clearly avoided because it takes work. People seem to now be sighing a breath of relief as in some scenarios the AI can do that upfront work piece. But we should be very clear that taking this route has real tradeoffs and downsides. Sometimes you just have to put in the work.

Both AI and ML are game-changing.
The art is knowing when to use each — and in what order — to get the best result at the lowest cost and with the right controls.

1. Accurate numbers don’t win trust, useful numbers do. You can be 100% precise and still irrelevant if you’re not answering the right question.

2. Growth can hide bad unit economics for years. By the time you catch it, the fix is twice as expensive and twice as painful.

3.Overstaffing finance kills agility. A lean, sharp team with clear systems outperforms a bloated one with no direction every time.

4. Operators don’t read 20-tab workbooks. If your insights aren’t in their language, they’ll ignore them.

5. You don’t need more data, you need better questions. Most finance problems are decision problems in disguise.

6. Cash flow discipline is boring… until it’s the only thing keeping the company alive.

7. The hardest job isn’t building the model, it’s making the call when the model says something nobody wants to hear.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7360282529259487233,2025-08-10 12:15:02.412,"5 things that frustrate Sam Altman every CFO must know

1. The yes-man paradox

When ChatGPT was tuned to be friendly and agreeable, it comforted some users but also reinforced harmful illusions for others. When tuned to be more candid, it corrected false beliefs but removed a layer of emotional support. 

Every tweak in tone and truthfulness shifts who benefits and who feels alienated. There’s no free setting, only trade-offs that must be managed in public view.

2. Thousand-hour blind spots

GPT-5 excels at 3–60 minute reasoning chains, perfect for coding, analysis, and design tweaks. But the kind of problems that require months of sustained thinking, like proving a new theorem or running a full drug discovery pipeline, break it. 

The model can’t yet hold the same line of thought through hundreds of dependencies, evolving constraints, and experiment feedback loops. 

3. Starving for energy

The AI conversation obsesses over model size and benchmarks but ignores the harder limit: power. Training and running frontier models requires gigawatt-scale data centers. That’s the output of an entire nuclear reactor. 

Without massive investment in energy capacity, AI progress will slow not because of algorithms, but because we can’t turn the lights on.

4. The data ceiling

Feeding AI more of the internet no longer drives big gains. The web’s clean, high-quality datasets are already inside the model. The next leap won’t come from scraping. It will come from generating new information. 

That means simulated environments, synthetic challenges that push reasoning into new territory, and real-world experiments that collect data no one has seen before. AI will need to learn like scientists by creating the data it needs.

5. Human adaptation lag

AI capabilities can leap in a year. Societal norms, governance structures, and policy take decades. This mismatch creates a dangerous in-between: the tech is powerful enough to matter, but the guardrails aren’t built yet. 

That’s when misuse, over-trust, or public backlash can derail good progress. The frustration isn’t just about speed. It’s about the widening gap between 'can' and 'should.'

They were being honest.

Most firms don’t have a model for back-office leaders to reach the top.
Because they still see ops as:
→ Non-revenue
→ Important but not strategic
→ Supportive, but not core

But here’s the thing:
Private equity is starting to bet millions on ops.
In some cases, they’re buying it outright.

Only 2 things you need to build this:

1. Financials
2. Meeting transcripts

ChatGPT Agent will help analyze, structure, and narrate.

But you’ll still decide what story is worth telling.

The AI will handle analytics. 

While you handle storytelling using AI.

AI + Analyst = What happened
Analyst = Why did it happen
AI = The story

Your role as a CFO isn’t producing numbers.

It’s providing meaning.

Spreadsheets won't disappear.

But they’ve already stopped being enough.

The truth is finance is great at analysis but bad at translation.

That is the gap. 

And storytelling with AI is how you close it.

So I went ahead and built a full interactive dashboard for the next board meeting as a working, production-grade website in 10 minutes with financial storytelling using ChatGPT Agent.

Most founders think FP&A is about cleaning up spreadsheets.
Tracking last month’s budget.
Building reports for the board.

It’s not.

The real job of FP&A is to improve how fast and how well you make decisions.
Not just number accuracy, decision velocity.

If the only question FP&A is answering is “how did we do last month?”
You’re underusing it.

Here’s what great FP&A actually does 

→ helps you decide when to hire
Not just “can we afford it,” but “when does the ROI make sense?”

→ models what happens if burn increases 15%
Or if revenue dips. Or if churn creeps up.
The goal isn’t a perfect prediction, it’s a clear picture of risk.

→ pressure-tests new initiatives
Will that product line break even?
Will this expansion cannibalize margins?

→ helps you say no
Because not all growth is good growth.
FP&A helps you spot what looks great on paper but erodes long-term value.

→ turns instinct into strategy
Gut calls still matter.
But FP&A turns them into measurable, modelable bets with eyes wide open.

Yes, budgeting matters.
Yes, reporting is essential.

But if FP&A isn’t changing how you operate…
If it’s not shaping your next move…
If your finance team isn’t part of the strategy room…

Private equity can’t technically own law firms.
But it’s getting close.
Closer than most people realize.

Through a structure called a managed services organization (MSO), PE firms are starting to:
→ Acquire all the business infrastructure of law firms
→ Lock in long-term contracts
→ Control operations — without touching legal equity

It’s not ownership. But it feels like it.

More importantly, it validates something I’ve seen in every PE-backed professional services firm I’ve worked with:

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7359195773911101441,2025-08-07 12:16:39.458,"3 rules for a great board meeting every CFO must know:

1. Win the meeting before it starts

A surprise in the boardroom is a failure of your process. Your job is to de-risk the meeting weeks in advance.

(4 weeks out). Align with your CEO on the core narrative.

(2 weeks out). Socialize tough ideas. 1-on-1 with key directors to build allies.

(1 week out). Deliver the final package early with no last-minute changes.

2. Architect the narrative, not the deck

Your board deck isn't a data dump. It's a strategic story designed to guide the conversation. Every slide must have a purpose.

Lead with a 1-page summary. If they only read this, they get the full picture.

Use visual charts, not dense tables. Show the why behind the numbers.

Go deep on ONE big issue. Dedicate 50% of your time to the strategic 
decision that matters most.

3. Deliver bad news like a LEADER

A tough quarter or a budget miss is a test of your leadership. 

Don't hide from it. Address it head-on. Inform key people early. The board meeting should never be a surprise party for bad news.

Own it directly. Address the problem up front. No spin, no excuses. Come with a plan. Never present a problem without a solution. Frame the entire discussion around the path forward.

Stop just presenting the numbers.

Start leading the conversation.

(a mini-guide)

1. Balance sheets taught you order

Now learn chaos. FP&A is messy real-world data. Accept imperfect information. Perfect reconciliation won't exist here. Get comfortable with ""good enough.""

2. Stop asking, ""Is it right?"" 

Start asking, ""What's it telling us?"" A 3% variance might hide a dying product line. A growing margin could mask customer churn. Details whisper stories.

3. Your accounting mind spots risks

Use it differently. Don't just flag problems - model solutions. Run scenarios. Bad forecasts aren't failures. They're learning data.

4. Live in operations, not spreadsheets

Walk the warehouse. Shadow sales calls. Your best insights won't come from month-end reports. They'll come from seeing business happen.

5. Internal controls taught you process

Now break some rules. Test assumptions. Question standards. The best FP&A analysts are part challenger, part guardian.

6. Depreciation schedules don't drive decisions 

People do. Learn to read rooms, not just reports. Your audience needs direction, not decimal points.

7. Your GAAP knowledge is a superpower

You see patterns others miss. But don't be the ""technically correct"" person. Be the ""here's why it matters"" person. Tech skills get you in. Business instinct takes you higher.

CEO: Fine. But if we miss Q4, we miss Series D.

CFO: Then let’s stop guessing and start measuring.

CEO: Competitors are growing 180%. We’re at 72%. I want 150% by Q4. Double deployments. Add 120 people. Take 15% of Europe.

CFO: And burn cash doing it? Our LTV/CAC dropped to 2.8. Churn is rising. Forecast variance is ±25%. Are we scaling product-market fit—or magnifying inefficiencies?

CEO: Playing it safe already cost us. Competitor X closed $85M last quarter.

CFO: And what did that cost them? We’ve got 24 months of runway. They have 10. You want speed. I want durability. That last rushed release dropped NPS by 12 points.

BOTTOM LINE:

Weak CEO–CFO partnerships:

- Debate without data.
- Use consensus forecasts.
- Mistake silence for alignment.

Strong CEO–CFO partnerships:

- Forecast with discipline.
- Trust metrics over hope.
- Use tension to find truth.
- Debate hard, decide fast, own it.

The CEO owns the growth story. 

The CFO owns the math. 

Shareholders win when both do their jobs.

It took me years (and a few battle scars) to understand this.

In early-stage companies, the instinct is to add.

More tools.
More dashboards.
More analysis.
More meetings.

At first, it feels like momentum.

But over time, it turns into clutter.

Clutter that slows decisions.
Clutter that hides the real problems.
Clutter that makes everything feel urgent when very little actually is.

And the worst part?

No one’s moving faster.
No one’s making better calls.
Everyone’s just busier.

Here’s what actually works 

→ Fewer KPIs but the right ones
You don’t need 40 metrics. You need 4 that move the business.
Pick the ones that show risk early and drive action fast.

→ Leaner teams but with sharper roles
Most bloated teams aren’t slow because they’re big.
They’re slow because no one’s sure who owns what.

→ Simpler forecasts but built on real assumptions
You don’t need to model every line item.
You need to model the decisions that matter most.

→ Smaller scope but faster execution
Velocity wins.
A focused plan you can execute now beats a perfect plan that takes 3 months to align.

Scaling is about subtraction.

Cut the noise.
Shrink the surface area.
Double down on what matters.

Because clarity compounds.
And the best teams don’t just move fast.
They move with purpose.

Internal finance.

And people thought I was out of my mind.

Back in 2020, I’d been on the Strategic Finance team at one of the top PE-backed OCFO advisory firms for three years.
→ I was the go-to for the firm’s most complex modeling and BI projects.
→ Bringing in real business from top-tier PE firms — years before my title said I should.
→ I had just been promoted to Director.
→ I was clearly on the path up.

So why raise my hand to go internal — to run finance ops?
To fix timesheets and build forecast templates?

Because I saw a firm on the verge of something bigger — and I knew internal finance could make or break it.

It wasn’t about plugging gaps.

It was about building a real operating engine:
 → A planning rhythm tied to actual goals
 → A long-range view that supported both organic and inorganic growth
 → Hiring models aligned to delivery capacity and margin
 → Forecasts that held up under board scrutiny
 → Metrics that didn’t just track — but shaped — performance

And no — I wasn’t worried about how it would look.

I had deep relationships across the consulting team. They knew me.
We’re still close — and the mutual respect never wavered.

I also knew: if I helped the firm succeed financially, the comp and promotions would take care of themselves.

And honestly?

It helped me stand out.

I got leadership exposure I never would’ve gotten on the traditional path.
(And let’s be real — the back office always seemed like it was having the most fun.)

Most firms assume that if they sell finance, they’re good at running it themselves.

But even the best ones underinvest in internal finance — not out of neglect, but because:
1️⃣ Top talent stays on the client side
2️⃣ Leadership assumes the model is “simple”
3️⃣ The role has no natural champion — it’s less visible, less prestigious, and harder to staff

But if you’re trying to scale and don’t have a finance function that helps you plan, pivot, and allocate — you’re just hoping for the best.

I didn’t step back.

I stepped into the part of the business no one else wanted to touch — but that held the key to sustainable growth.

Finance isn’t just what you sell. It’s how you scale.

If you're leading an accounting or OCFO advisory firm, here’s a question worth asking:
Has anyone like me ever raised their hand to build your internal finance function?

If not — why not?
Does it matter?

It did for us.

And if you’re serious about scaling, it probably matters more than you think.

When everyone else panics about uncertainty, you thrive on it. Market volatility? More variables to play with. Restructuring? Fresh data patterns to discover. Crisis? Pure opportunity. You learn that disorder is where the real insights hide. 
   
While others need perfect data, you profit from noise. Because in the age of AI and automation, being comfortable with complexity is your last defensible skill.
   
3. Trust is your true deliverable
   
The most powerful revelation in FP&A: perfect accuracy isn't impressive. It's the minimum requirement. A single validated insight outweighs a thousand clever theories. While others trade on relationships and politics, you build influence through pure reliability. 
   
There's no margin for error, one compromised analysis destroys years of earned trust. In the end, you're not judged on your talent, creativity, or vision. You're judged on whether you've ever been wrong.
   
Don’t get me wrong, business school teaches frameworks.
But FP&A teaches survival.
And that’s the part that actually matters.",99,29,5,133,29.29,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eriklidman_3-fpa-lessons-no-mba-professor-can-teach-activity-7358470590640406528-h1Cz

1. You kill good ideas to make room for great ones.

2. Excel mastery isn’t your superpower. Knowing which numbers not to track is.

3. The best CFOs don’t just present numbers. They craft narratives that win over boards and CEOs.

4. Spreadsheets look neat, but the real risks and rewards are hidden in the details.

5. The numbers everyone agrees on are often the most misleading. Your job is to say ""no"" more than ""yes.""

6. Being liked isn’t the goal. The best CFOs are respected, even when they appear to be bad. 

7. Your real deliverable isn’t just reports. It’s peace of mind. The CEO sleeps at night because you’ve got the future covered.

8. You’re not a yes-man. You’re the CEO’s conscience, ready to disagree without being disagreeable.

9. Small risks become big threats, and it’s your job to see them first. That’s the art of productive paranoia.

10. Sometimes, you have to crush someone’s passion project with math. Do it with empathy, but don’t avoid it.

11. Every ""no"" isn’t just about saving dollars. It’s about saving time, the most valuable resource of all. 

It’s one of the hardest roles in business.

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7358178166357532672,2025-08-04 16:53:03.199,"If I could advise my younger self as a finance intern at GM many years ago, here’s what I’d say:

“Knowing the numbers is good.
Understanding how decisions actually happen, that’s better.”

The past few years taught me what textbooks never did.
The pressure. The pivots. The late nights. The tradeoffs.

From intern to CFO, the real learning came from asking better questions, over and over again.

If I had to distill it down, here are 6 things I wish I knew sooner:

1. Understand the business before building the model.
A forecast built in a vacuum will always break under pressure.

2. Spend more time listening to operators than perfecting reports.
The real levers of performance live outside the spreadsheet.

3. Don’t hide behind data. Interpret it.
Your job isn’t to be precise. It’s to drive action.

4. Learn to say, “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.”
That line builds more trust than faking it ever will.

5. Push for clarity, not complexity.
Great CFOs simplify. They don’t make things harder than they need to be.

6. Know when done is better than perfect.
In high-growth companies, speed beats polish every time.

Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7358110881139802112,2025-08-04 12:25:41.153,"FP&A is a great career choice for 3 reasons:

1. FP&A is a faster path to becoming a CFO. The skills you gain, such as financial modeling, analysis, reporting, and strategy, lend themselves well to roles like finance manager, finance director, CFO, and beyond. FP&A also allows you to specialize in areas like capital expenditure planning, M&A due diligence, or product profitability, which can help further progress your career. Successful FP&A professionals have many opportunities for career advancement.

2. FP&A professionals work at the intersection of finance and the rest of the business. Through forecasting, analysis, and strategic insights, FP&A helps shape key business decisions and initiatives. By understanding both the financial and operational perspectives, FP&A professionals can have a real influence on a company's direction, goal setting, and overall success. The work of FP&A professionals leaves an imprint on a company and is truly value-added.

3. You get exposed to all aspects of the business through financial planning, analysis, reporting, and strategy. FP&A professionals are involved in a wide variety of tasks, from forecasting and budgeting to process improvements and cost-saving initiatives. This career will keep you on your toes and continuously learning.

The 13-week forecast is out of date. Variance commentary is missing.

But the board review is tomorrow.

Even high-performing treasury teams today spend 2–3 hours every day building a view of daily cash. And up to 8 hours a week just to roll forward the short-term forecast.

- Outdated tools.
- Fragmented data.

2008: CFO at Gilead Sciences
2025: President & COFO at Salesforce

Robin Washington is the first woman to become Chief Operating and Financial Officer (COFO) at a Fortune 100 company.

The CFO role is changing within Fortune 100 and beyond. 

But the CFO isn’t trying to become the COO. 

They always were. CFOs ran:

- Vendor stack
- GTM execution
- Data architecture
- Planning systems
- Headcount strategy
- Risk, cash, and compliance

Operations today aren’t about warehouses.

It’s about dashboards, decisions, and precision.

And no one understands those levers better than Finance.

The modern CFO is the operating system of the company.

The old split model doesn’t work anymore:

CFO = numbers
COO = ops 

You can’t scale decision-making if finance and operations live in silos. In high-functioning teams, shared accountability is dead.

They want one leader who sees it all. 

And owns the outcome.

That leader is the CFO. 

Not the spreadsheet CFO.

- But the one who speaks GTM fluently.
- Who talks in tradeoffs, not just budgets.
- Who connects cost to capacity to culture.

The one who doesn’t just ask, Can we afford it?
 
But says, Does this even make sense?

TAKEAWAY

Robin Washington runs finance and operations at a $300B+ cloud giant.

The COFO badge isn’t about vanity.

It’s a signal for what CFOs are becoming.

Most finance teams don’t need more headcount.

They need better systems.

Because the real cost isn’t payroll, it’s time wasted on broken workflows.

Here are 5 decisions that buy back hours (and sanity):

→ centralize your source of truth
Stop pulling numbers from 6 places.
One dashboard. One model. One set of clean assumptions.

→ standardize your review cycles
Random check-ins create chaos.
Set a rhythm, weekly burn review, monthly close, quarterly forecast.
Rinse and repeat.

→ simplify your chart of accounts
If your GL looks like a junk drawer, reporting will always be messy.
Group what matters. Archive what doesn’t. Build reports that answer real questions.

→ cut the manual steps
If someone’s dragging formulas across tabs, you’re doing it wrong.
Use tools that automate reconciliation, clean inputs, and trigger workflows.

→ decide what doesn’t get done
Not every report needs to exist.
Not every metric needs weekly updates.
Focus on decisions, not data for data’s sake.

Finance isn’t just about the numbers.

It’s about how the numbers flow.

Automate manual work. Agent logs into your systems, finds files, matches transactions, and drafts emails. It handles the busywork.

Turn chaos into order. Throw it messy exports from different ERPs. It lines them up and shows you what doesn’t match.

Prepares reports. Give it raw data. It builds the first draft of your board deck or financial summary.

Acts like a smart analyst. Agent checks, thinks, acts, and checks again. Without you babysitting every step.

2. AI Agents give you back your time

You spend less time cleaning up files and more time on what matters. No more living in spreadsheets. No more chasing numbers or babysitting routine work.
But every AI agent relies on humans to perform well.

You can give it limited access. Want an agent to check your calendar only? Only share your calendar. Don’t open your whole inbox unless you have to.
Don’t set and forget. Review what Agent does. If it flags a mismatch, check it before you send.

Why and how to use it?

Why: You get your time back. Your team spends less time cleaning up files and more time on what matters. No more living in spreadsheets. No more chasing numbers.

How: I automated the entire process with ChatGPT Agent and honestly, I think this is what everyone in finance has been waiting for.

In this example below in comments, I’ll walk you through how I used the ChatGPT Agent to automate the most boring finance task.

Wouter Born,wouterborn,inspiration,7356658662305685505,2025-07-31 12:15:05.202,"3 things you must never miss in the financial storytelling process:

1. Let AI do the analysis to give you the “what.”

AI can break down numbers. It can tell you:

Sales are down $2,000.
Store XYZ missed the target.
Online training bookings dropped.

That’s helpful. But it’s just the mechanical answer.

The analysis tells you what happened.

Not why it happened.

2. Only the Analyst knows the “why.”

AI has no idea that:

Inventory was delayed.
Store XYZ had 3 new hires.
Marketing paused campaigns last minute.

That context doesn’t live in the data.

It lives with the team.

And without it, the AI-generated narrative is incomplete.

Or worse, misleading.

3. Combine both and you get the story.

Once AI has:

The quantitative analysis (the what)
And the human explanation (the why)

Then, and only then, can it produce a concise, accurate, and relevant narrative.

Sales missed target due to underperformance in two locations, driven by staffing delays and supply chain issues.

Now you have something useful.

Not just a report.

But a story with meaning.

And that’s the loop.

AI doesn’t replace the Analyst. It partners with them. 

AI breaks down what happened. The Analyst explains why.

AI assembles the story. 

That’s how real financial storytelling gets built.

AI + Analyst = What
Analyst = Why
AI = Story

All of this starts with a fundamental belief:

You can’t write a useful story until you’ve done useful analysis.

And AI, done right, changes everything.",63,27,8,98,42.86,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wouterborn_3-things-you-must-never-miss-in-the-financial-activity-7356658662305685505-V8Vs
Erik Lidman,eriklidman,inspiration,7356658652897783808,2025-07-31 12:15:02.959,"3 ways FP&A quietly builds CFOs:

1. You make their political battles winnable
   
Your data turns their gut no into an undeniable business case. When the CEO wants that flashy acquisition or Sales demands more headcount, your analysis transforms uncomfortable pushback into cold, hard logic. In the corporate battlefield, you don't just provide numbers. You provide the winning hand.
   
2. You're their pattern breaker
   
You spot the lies businesses tell themselves. When ‘it's different this time’ comes with a 100-slide deck, your models reveal the painful truth: same strategy that collapsed margins in Q3, same assumptions that missed by 40% last summer, same blind spots that cost the last CFO their job. In a business built on selective memory, you're the database of expensive lessons.
   
3. You turn soft power into hard numbers
   
Behind the corporate buzzwords, you quantify the unquantifiable. That strong culture everyone talks about? Your analysis shows it's worth 23% lower turnover costs. The brand value Marketing keeps mentioning? Your models prove it commands an 8% premium over competitors. The operational excellence in every presentation? You measure it in inventory turns and cash conversion cycles. While others wave vague concepts, you transform corporate intangibles into balance sheet realities. In a world of feel-good metrics, you show which soft assets actually drive hard returns.
   
No FP&A, no credibility.",88,26,2,116,29.55,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eriklidman_3-ways-fpa-quietly-builds-cfos-1-you-activity-7356658652897783808-UUNQ

Over the years, I’ve automated everything else in the monthly reporting pack—financials, KPIs, dashboards. The tech is there. So am I.

But I still haven’t automated Management Discussion & Analysis.

Not because I can’t.
Because I haven’t wanted to.

For a while, I leaned on excuses:
→ “The tools aren’t good enough.” (They are now.)
→ “We can’t put sensitive data into AI.” (Most companies are getting comfortable.)

So what’s left?

MD&A is the part that forces you to think.
You sit with the numbers.
You ask hard questions.
You turn noise into narrative and narrative into action.

It’s not just output. It’s practice.

And that’s what makes me hesitate—because once you skip that step, you skip the learning.

If we bring up an entire generation of analysts without ever asking them to take a stab at MD&A, how are they going to build the strategic muscles we say we value?

Can I automate MD&A for you?
Absolutely.

But think seriously about whether you want me to.
Some friction is worth keeping.

Sales can miss by 30%, and it’s the market.
HR can delay hiring, tight talent pool.

But Finance?

Miss a forecast by 5%, and it’s a strategic failure.

Funny, right?
Everyone else gets context.
Finance gets accountability.

Nobody asks what changed upstream.
They ask why you didn’t see it coming.

The bar for FP&A isn’t ‘accurate.’
It’s omniscient.’

Here’s the catch:
71% of CFOs say improving forecast accuracy is a top priority.
But most planning cycles rely on late inputs, fragile assumptions, and zero operational visibility.

No signal from HR.
No updates from Sales.
But full responsibility from Finance.

This isn’t a forecasting problem.
It’s a business rhythm problem.

So what’s next?

- Stop polishing slides. Start fixing decision latency.
- Forecasts update when reality shifts, not quarterly.
- Missed targets trigger review, not just apology emails.
- Planning isn’t a spreadsheet. It’s operational discipline.
- No assumptions without owners. No owners, no model.
- Tie accuracy to performance, org-wide, not just Finance.
- Inputs aren’t favors. They’re mandatory and time-bound.

The good news?
You don’t need more reporting.
You need pressure in the right places.

The WSJ just published a sobering look at how AI is hollowing out the bottom of the white-collar workforce. Entry-level roles are vanishing across finance, tech, and professional services.

The chart says it all.

🟧 Professional services firms are laying off more bachelor’s-level workers than before the AI boom—even as the sector keeps growing.

Now, you all know how AI-positive I am. I’ve written plenty about the upside—especially for finance teams. 

But I’ve also flagged this risk many times before:
→ If you eliminate junior work without rethinking how you build talent,
 you don’t get lean—you get hollow.

👉 The value of junior employees isn’t just what they produce. It’s who they become.

Grunt work wasn’t just cost—it was apprenticeship. That’s how people used to develop judgment, pattern recognition, and domain fluency. You can’t skip straight to “trusted advisor.”

And let’s be clear:
→ Firms don’t invest in junior talent to be nice.
→ They do it because future capability requires it.

If we stop making that investment—because AI can do the work—we’re not just saving money. We’re quietly mortgaging the next generation of managers and leaders.

In accounting and OCFO advisory, the model was always:
→ Hire sharp grads
→ Let them learn by doing
→ Promote from within

If step 2 disappears—and we skip step 1 altogether—what’s left for step 3?

📉 This isn’t just a talent issue. It’s a future P&L issue.

👇 Curious—what are you doing differently to develop the next layer of leaders?

Same. So I tried modeling it.

After posting about Claude’s financial services capabilities, I started tracking impressions manually—timestamps, screenshots, Excel, the whole thing.

📈 The pink dots are actual impressions.
🟢 The green curve is an exponential fit I created midday on Day 1 (dotted line marks 3:00 PM).

And weirdly… the post has hugged the curve almost perfectly ever since.
There were a few small deviations—like a slowdown around 4–6pm (as people wrapped up work), then an evening lull, then a late-night and next-morning bump. But overall, it stuck close.

Even more interesting?

This pattern—exponential decay with minor time-of-day noise—matches what I’ve seen anecdotally in many of my other posts.

And yes, at one point LinkedIn thought I was a bot and made me sign a compliance agreement saying I wouldn’t scrape data 😂
(Apparently I took this a little too seriously.)

But I can’t help asking:
→ Is this “decay curve” the norm for everyone now?
→ Have algo changes made posts more predetermined?
→ Or is there still room to defy gravity with the right engagement burst?

- Scenarios that reveal risk before it hits
- Financial logic embedded across every decision
- Insights that turn strategy into action

- Fixing broken spreadsheets
- Pulling data from disconnected tools
- Chasing numbers instead of influencing outcomes

- They lead, not wait.
- They scale systems, not patch them.
- They speak in business impact, not just models.

If you work in or around #Finance, you’ve probably felt it:
🚀 The buzz
📈 The demos
💬 The posts claiming analysts just got replaced by a chatbot

And now?

Anthropic dropped Claude for Financial Services — and people are losing it.
→ “Claude for Finance is here!”
→ “Finally, an AI for CFOs!”
→ “Say goodbye to Excel jockeys!”

But let’s take a beat.

💡 What Do We Actually Mean by “Finance”?
It’s one of the most overloaded words in business.
Depending on the context, “finance” might refer to:

🏢 Corporate Finance (the function)
→ FP&A
→ Accounting
→ Treasury
→ Internal Audit
→ Finance systems
👉 Reports to the CFO. Manages the business from the inside.

🏦 ""High"" Finance (the industry)
→ Investment Banking
→ Private Equity
→ Hedge Funds
→ Asset & Wealth Management
→ Insurance
👉 Deals with capital markets, capital allocation, and risk.
This is financial services.

🔍 Why This Distinction Matters — Especially Now
Anthropic didn’t launch Claude for Finance.
They launched Claude for Financial Services.
That’s not semantics. That’s strategy.

This product was built for:
→ Bridgewater Associates (hedge fund research)
→ Blackstone (private equity deal analysis)
→ Goldman Sachs (investment banking workflows)
→ AIG (insurance underwriting)
→ Vanguard (asset management reporting)

It connects to:
✅ S&P
✅ FactSet
✅ Morningstar

Not:
🚫 NetSuite
🚫 Workday
🚫 Adaptive Planning


🤝 But Is There Any Crossover? Yes — and it’s worth noting.

There is some overlap in the types of work being done. Claude FS can handle:
→ Complex modeling (DCF, scenario analysis)
→ Parsing dense financial documents
→ Supporting risk-style frameworks and simulations
So it may offer value to power users in a CFO org — those doing more advanced or adjacent work.

But here’s the catch:
📌 That’s incidental, not intentional.

Claude FS wasn’t built to optimize planning cycles, variance analysis, or close processes. It's built for an industry, not for a function.

It’s designed for capital markets professionals, not finance departments.
That distinction matters — especially when setting expectations or piloting tools.

⚠️ What Happens When We Get This Wrong?
→ CFOs get excited about the wrong solution
→ Corporate finance teams spin up pilots that underwhelm
→ Thought leaders misrepresent what these models actually do

📚 Want to Dig Deeper?
Glenn Hopper shared a thoughtful breakdown of Claude FS in his recent Deep Finance Dispatch newsletter. His take leans slightly toward the finance function side of the conversation, but he covers the capabilities and strategic implications in depth. Definitely worth a read if you're following the AI-in-finance space.

👇 Bottom Line
There’s incredible potential for AI in corporate finance.
But Claude FS is not that product.

→ It’s for high finance, not month-end close.

So let’s stay excited — but let’s also stay precise.

• We need a bigger budget
• Our tech stack is outdated
• We don't have enough people
• Leadership doesn't value finance
• The market moves too fast for our current processes

Why FP&A actually fails:

• Processes are reactive instead of proactive
• Data lives in too many disconnected systems
• Everyone becomes a firefighter instead of a strategic advisor
• Communication gap between finance and other departments
• Too much time spent gathering data, not enough analyzing it
• Teams rely heavily on manual spreadsheets and tribal knowledge
• Forecasts aren't connected to operational metrics that drive the business

The monthly close and reporting cycle is the most critical part of FP&A operations. And it's where most teams get stuck. 

Manual processes consume 70%+ of available time.

You won't transform your FP&A function overnight.

But you should start doing this:

→ standardizing key processes

This is how finance pros create stunning visuals in minutes using ChatGPT:

Most finance professionals still rely on outdated templates or spend hours building custom dashboards and pitch visuals.

But the top-performing consultants, FP&A leads, and CFOs?

They’ve started using ChatGPT to generate high-impact financial images instantly.

❌ Here’s what happens when you don’t use visual automation:
- You waste time formatting slide decks
- Your insights get lost in spreadsheets
- Your audience tunes out from info overload

✅ Now imagine this instead:
- You deliver client-ready visuals in minutes
- You generate branded dashboards at scale
- You turn insights into action with less effort

Here’s a cheatsheet I created to help finance professionals do exactly that

10 Use Cases to Master:

1. Quality Infographics

2. Scenario Planning Diagrams

3. Forecast Walkthroughs

4. Client Dashboards

5. Process Improvement Diagrams

6. Storytelling Slides

7. KPI Pitch Decks

8. Visual Templates

9. Policy Change Explainers

10. Org Charts & Strategic Maps

Each section includes:
- A practical ChatGPT prompt
- An example output
- A ready-to-use visual format

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7354517850692173824,2025-07-25 14:28:15.939,"Most founders hire a full-time CFO when they need a part-time controller.

And it kills their runway AND their cap table.

Actually, let me correct that.

You don't need a part-time controller.

You need a part-time controller AND a part-time CFO.

Just not 40 hours a week each.

I've built teams across 3 continents. Led finance at both large publicly traded companies and privately held growth firms.

Here's what actually works:

Part-time Controller = 5 hours/week
→ Clean books
→ Burn tracking  
→ Month-end close
→ $150/hour. Zero equity.

Part-time CFO = 3 hours/month
→ Strategic planning
→ Board prep
→ Fundraising guidance
→ $300/hour. Zero equity.

Total damage: $50K/year for both.

Compare that to:

Full-time CFO: $300K + 1.5% equity = $1M+ true cost

For doing both jobs. Badly.

Because here's the truth:

A great CFO hates doing controller work.

A great controller isn't ready for board meetings.

You need both perspectives.

Just not full-time.

The smart scaling path:

Start with hours. Scale to days. Eventually go full-time.

It grows with your business.

Not your ego.

Controller hours increase first.

CFO involvement follows.

Both scale based on actual need.

Most founders get this backwards.

They hire senior when they need execution.

Pay for full-time when they need fractional.

Give equity when hourly works fine.

The result?

Burned runway. Diluted cap table. Wrong expertise.

What's your current finance setup?

And is it actually what you need?

Let's get honest below 👇

Here's what stops FP&A from being a CFO...
And how to get out of this trap:

1. VCs want dealmakers, not data miners. You can model 10 years out but can't read a term sheet. CFOs spend more time in pitch meetings than on pivot tables. Raising capital needs street smarts, not just financial smarts.

2. You're the bottleneck nobody talks about. Sales needs pricing approval in 2 hours, not your 2-week ROI model. Product launched 3 features while waiting for your cost analysis. The business moves without you.

3. Playing ‘what-if’ games keeps you stuck. Building 20 scenarios for a $50K decision is overkill. Successful CFOs are making $5M calls based on gut and experience. Scale your thinking or stay small.

4. Missing operational experience hurts. Understanding unit economics from a spreadsheet isn't enough. Strong CFOs have run departments, managed teams, and fixed broken processes. They've felt the pain points they're solving.

My Profile,saulmateos,own,7353797797436874752,2025-07-23 14:47:01.865,"The 3 questions every founder should be able to answer about cash

You don’t need to be a CFO.
But you do need to see the ground you're running on.

Because most startups don’t die from bad ideas.
They run out of time, cash, or both.

And the warning signs don’t scream.
They whisper.

Here are the three questions that keep you from drifting into trouble:

1. How much cash do we actually have right now?
Not what the P&L says.
Not what Stripe shows before transfers.
Not what’s “coming soon” in accounts receivable.

Your real cash position lives in your bank account.
Today.
Not after you pay bills, run payroll, or settle taxes.
If you’re not watching it closely, you’re flying blind.

2. How long will that cash last under stress?
Most founders know their burn.
But they don’t pressure-test it.

What happens if revenue dips 20%?
What if churn creeps up?
What if that fundraise takes 3 months longer?

Runway isn’t about how long your cash could last.
It’s how long it will last once the real world starts pushing back.

3. What assumptions are we betting the business on?
Cash forecasts are only as useful as the assumptions behind them.

→ Are we counting on a sales ramp that’s never happened before?
→ Are we assuming pricing holds steady in a changing market?
→ Are we planning spend before we’ve proven the return?

The worst part isn’t being wrong.
It’s not knowing where you were guessing in the first place.

A founder doesn’t need to build the model.
But they need to know what it’s telling them and what it’s not.

Because clarity buys time.
Time buys better decisions.
And better decisions keep the lights on.

Here’s how I’m preparing my own kid—and what I’d tell any parent asking the same question.

I have thought about this a lot over the last weeks.

The result is this: I have identified 3 future-proof path for our kids (and probably ourselves too!)

1. THE MEGA EXPERT
Their superpower: judgement
Mantra: “An AI can generate answers. I provide the right one.”

What they actually do:
- Spot when AI recommendations ignore real-world signals
- Choose the 1 insight that matters from 1,000 AI-generated options
- Add context, nuance, and “so what?” to raw AI analysis
- Catch flaws in AI forecasts before they mislead leadership

How to become one:
- Get a Master's degree or specialized certifications
- Become a voracious reader of foundational texts and research
- Find a master mentor with 20+ years in the field
- Practice explaining complexity simply

Hidden risk: Intellectual stubbornness


2. THE AI SAVVY
Their superpower: acceleration
Mantra: “I don’t work harder. I build systems that work for me.”

What they actually do:
- Build internal AI tools (e.g. churn-risk detectors from CRM data)
- Vibe code tools/apps with no-code + LLM APIs
- Launch outbound campaigns with AI-personalized messaging
- Automate workflows using LLMs and APIs

How to become one:
- 2h Daily practice with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Lovable)
- Build small AI projects to solve real problems
- Mastering prompt engineering (I have FREE infographics + courses about this, go to my page & follow)
- Think like an engineer: “Where’s the friction AI can remove?”

Hidden risk: Superficiality where you become a jack of all tools with no depth or impact


3. THE META HUMAN
Their superpower: influence
Mantra: “The best algorithm can’t close a deal or inspire a team. I can.”

What they actually do:
- Mediate conflicts between data and intuition-driven teams
- Present complex AI plans persuasively to the board
- Sense what AI can’t like human nuance, company politics, taste
- Lead cross-functional teams with psychological safety

How to become one:
- Study human nature
- Seek high-stakes communication roles
- Learn to lead without a title
- Practice active listening

Hidden risk: Strategic miscalculation—ignoring what AI can/can’t do and risking poor judgment

You don’t need to master all 3 right now.
Here is what you can do:
- Choose one of these 3 as your major
- But also one of them to develop as your minor

Which of the 3 personas do you see yourself becoming?

Most founders don’t plan to run finance forever.
But they end up doing it longer than they should.

Because it feels faster.
Because it feels safer.
Because it’s hard to let go of the numbers.

Until the team is stuck.
Waiting on you.
And finance becomes a bottleneck, not a lever.

Here’s how to build a finance function that scales without you:

Start with visibility
You can’t delegate what you can’t see.
Set up basic reporting; burn, margin, runway that updates without you chasing it.
Make clarity the default.

Delegate the mechanics
Bookkeeping, payables, payroll, reporting cleanup, get it off your plate early.
These are repeatable tasks that steal focus from strategic work.

Retain the decisions (for now)
You don’t need to let go of every call.
But you do need a system for making decisions; forecasting, trade-offs, priorities without starting from scratch every time.

Upgrade from owner to reviewer
Move from building the model to reviewing the assumptions.
From chasing invoices to understanding where cash is going next.

Founders don’t need to run finance forever.
They need to design it so it runs without them.

Would the board cite it in key decisions?

Here's what great FP&A 'products' deliver in 2025:

1. Insight engine, not data archive
   
Traditional View: Revenue dropped 8% below forecast
   
Strategic Approach: Our top 3 enterprise customers are testing competitor products. They represent $15M ARR. Here's why: Our payment terms block deals. Competitors offer 60 days, we demand 30. Cost to match = $300K in working capital. Cost to lose them = $15M + 40% logo churn spike.
   
2. Dynamic, not static
   
Past Practice: Your competitor just raised $100M and is burning it on 50% discounts. Your quarterly forecast assumed stable pricing. Average deal size dropped 30% this week.
   
Modern Strategy: Top-performing teams already modeled this scenario last month and have 3 counter-moves ready:
   
  - Bundle shift to boost product attachment
  - Strategic price floors with comp adjustments
  - Targeted expansion offers to protected accounts

3. Outcome-oriented
   
Standard Report: CAC up 40% YoY
   
Impact-Driven View: Every dollar in brand marketing returns $0.60. Every dollar in sales training returns $3.40. Moving $2M between them nets $5.6M in new ARR. Here's the 30-day implementation plan.
   
4. Business-first language
   
Basic Update: G&A expenses exceeded budget by $800K
   
Value-Based Analysis: We have 7 project management tools, 5 BI platforms, and 3 CRMs. Cost of redundancy: $1.2M annually. Cost to consolidate: $200K one-time. Net savings: $1M yearly. Plus: 20% productivity gain from unified systems. Timeline to savings: 90 days

Choosing the type of role to apply for. 

After spending over a decade leading FP&A teams and helping 1,000+ finance professionals master these skills, I can tell you that choosing the wrong role can set your career back years.

Here are the five types of FP&A roles and what you'll do in each one:

#1 Finance Business Partnering Role

•You partner with one or several departments, helping them make better decisions and holding them accountable.

•You do a bit of everything, including forecasting, financial analysis to support investment decisions, and month-end close analysis.

​
#2 Consolidations / Reporting Role

•This is a more specialized role. Your objective is to summarize the information you receive from other Finance and FP&A teams.

•You’ll prepare presentations and models at the total company level for senior executives.
​

#3 Center of Excellence Role

•Large companies further narrow the focus to run a given activity at scale and more efficiently.

•For example, Unilever, the consumer goods giant, has teams that only focus on the financial analysis of long-term investments of a given product category.
​

#4 Project Role

•Most common are projects related to digital transformation. For instance, you may be asked to work on implementing a new ERP system or a restructuring project.

•Typically, you’ll need to tightly manage a forecast, budgets, and partner with team members from various functions.


#5 Full P&L Role

•Instead of partnering with just one department, you are managing the FP&A process of the entire business.

•This role includes all aspects of the Business Partnering Role, but in addition, you typically have more leadership exposure and are included in decisions that impact the entire company.

(a mini-guide for future FP&A professionals)

1. The but GAAP says... reflex
   
Step out of the rulebook. GAAP is your foundation, not your safety net. FP&A needs business logic, not accounting logic. Management doesn't care about ASC 606. They care about cash and growth.
   
2. The let me build a model instinct
   
Drop that reflex to model everything. While you're building the perfect Monte Carlo simulation, your CEO made three gut calls that moved markets. Sometimes a five-minute math beats your Excel trap. Business moves. Spreadsheets don't.
   
3. The not my department mentality
   
Quit being the numbers police. That marketing spend you're questioning? Go sit in their meetings. That R&D budget variance? Walk the lab floor. Your job isn't to judge from afar. It's to understand from within. Cross the bridge to their world.
   
4. The net-zero illusion
   
Stop hiding behind offsetting variances. Two wrongs don't make a strategic right. That positive variance in Region A isn't fixing the real problem in Region B. Each deviation has its own story. Learn to unpack them.
   
Bonus: The safe answer trap

Stop waiting for someone to tell you it's right. In FP&A, there is no right. Only useful or useless.

Remember

Your job isn't to be correct.

It's to help the business win.

Your accounting background is valuable.

But it's just your starting point.

Level 1: I make pretty spreadsheets
Level 2: I spot trends in data
Level 3: I provide insights
Level 4: I shape business strategy
Level 5: I drive company growth

Most stop at Level 2.
Few reach Level 5.

The difference?

Level 2s wait for questions.
Level 5s question everything.

Here's how to reach Level 5:

1. Master the pre-meeting strategy
   
Data tells you what happened. People tell you why.
   
Before touching Excel:
   
  - Review customer feedback trends
  - Check competitor earnings transcripts
  - Call sales leaders about pipeline changes
  - Message ops managers about production issues
   
When others bring data, you bring context. That's how you own the room.
   
2. Build your business partner network
   
Your models are only as good as your business understanding. Period.
   
Make it happen:
   
  - Share industry insights unprompted
  - Volunteer for cross-functional projects
  - Join their team meetings (even uninvited)
  - Create monthly coffee rotations with department heads
   
The best insights live between departments. Be the bridge.
   
3. Own the so-what framework
   
Every analysis must answer:
   
  - So what's the cost of inaction?
  - So what's our next best move?
  - So what should we do differently?
  - So what does this mean for our strategy?
   
Perfect analysis without direction is just noise.
   
Don't describe the past. Shape the future.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7351561349476278272,2025-07-17 10:40:11.12,"“How do I break into private equity?”
I get this question all the time—from consultants, operators, and advisory firm leaders trying to work with #PE-backed companies.

And I get it. Because I asked it too—just not in the way people expected.
In 2011, during business school, I told a classmate I wasn’t going to follow the traditional path.

No banking. No deal team.

I was going to go deep into corporate finance—become the kind of operator PE firms would eventually need.

He laughed. Friendly laugh. It wasn’t a thing back then.

Operating partners were rare. Value creation meant cost-cutting and consolidation. Strategy lived in pitch decks. #Finance lived in spreadsheets.
But I believed that would change.

Years later, it did.

A friend called. He’d just joined a PE-focused advisory firm and thought I had the right background to join. That call kicked off a daisy chain of relationships—and before long, I was in the room.

Advising sponsors. Scaling finance. Helping portfolio companies bridge the messy middle between strategy and execution.

And here’s what I’ve learned from inside the machine:

✅ There is no front door.
#PrivateEquity firms don’t pick from formal vendor lists. They rely on relationships. Memory. Timing.
You’re either on the mental short list—or you’re invisible.

✅ Timing is never ideal.
You won’t get the call when you need work. You’ll get it when they hit a problem—if you’re top of mind.

✅ Partners aren’t always the buyer.
Directors and VPs on deal teams often make vendor decisions. They may seem junior on paper—but in practice, they run point. Don’t overlook them.

✅ Operating teams are your in.
The fastest-growing PE firms now have full-scale ops groups—some with 50+ people.
Their job? Fill gaps. Accelerate execution. Source the right outside help.
If you know how to speak their language, they want to hear from you.

✅ Backdoor access exists.
If you’re already working with a PE-backed company, don’t wait for an invite.
Executives often skip involving the sponsor—but looping them in builds trust.
PE firms appreciate visibility. And they remember the advisors who deliver with transparency.

✅ You might already be adjacent.
If you’ve worked with VC-backed SaaS companies, you’re closer than you think.
Firms like Francisco Partners, Hg, Insight Partners, and Vista Equity Partners own companies that look a lot like the ones you’ve already helped.

So no, I didn’t break into PE the traditional way.
But I knew the need.
I went deep in my craft.
And when the industry finally caught up—I was ready.
These days, I help others do the same.

Whether you’re:
→ A solo advisor trying to land your first portco
→ Building a new #OCFO practice
→ Or running a service firm looking to go upstream
I help translate operational expertise into PE relevance.

1. Automation won't save you (yet)

You can't automate chaos. Every failed implementation I've seen started with teams ignoring their broken processes and inconsistent data standards. Stop buying expensive tools to do bad work faster. Bad data at light speed is still bad data.

2. Business partners are your real stakeholders, not finance

Stop obsessing over what your CFO thinks. Your fancy MoM comparisons mean nothing to a Product Manager losing market share. That 50-tab model? Your Sales VP needs one number, not fifty. Build relationships and deliverables that serve their needs.

3. Your forecast accuracy metrics are meaningless

Celebrating 95% accuracy in a stable market isn't success. It's basic math. Real FP&A value comes from spotting market shifts before they hit your P&L. Stop measuring how well you predict the obvious.

4. Your headcount planning is fiction

Still planning heads by counting boxes in org charts? The future of work is fluid - contractors, AI, automation, and hybrid roles. Modern FP&A teams plan for capability needs, not headcounts.

5. Your financial models are too financial

Building models that only speak finance? Your CEO thinks in market share, your CTO thinks in tech debt, and your CHRO thinks in talent flows. Today's FP&A teams translate business complexity, not just numbers.

BOTTOM LINE

Stop playing accountant when you should be playing strategist.

Make mistakes. Learn from them.

But always learn from other people's mistakes first.

P.S. I could be wrong about the lessons and not everyone will resonate with them, and that's okay. I'm not the best advisor.

In my second, I built FP&A teams to drive it.

Now, I advise finance leaders and firms navigating the messy middle — between strategy and execution, between internal chaos and external pressure.

I learned a lot of this inside the world of #PrivateEquity — where timelines are short, expectations are high, and clarity is a survival skill.

But the same challenges show up outside of PE too:
➝ Accounting firms building #OCFO or #StrategicFinance practices
➝ Founder-led companies trying to scale finance
➝ Advisory teams trying to deliver more than spreadsheets

Here’s what I’ve seen across all of them:
➝ Economic rigor is useless if you can’t translate it into action
➝ Clean models collapse under unclear org structure
➝ Great strategy dies in workflows that weren’t built to scale

Most teams don’t need more hands — they need clarity.
(Okay, many do need more hands. But that alone won’t fix what’s actually broken.)

They need to know what matters. What can wait. And how to move forward without spinning out.

That’s what I help with.

Sometimes I’m the guide.
Sometimes I’m the architect.

But always, I bring structure when things get messy — and help teams move forward with confidence.

Manage your cash like fundraising will take six months longer than planned.
Because that’s what happens more often than not.

Too many plans assume:
→ Revenue picks up fast
→ Investors are quick to commit
→ The next round will land on time

But things get delayed.
Deals slow down.
And without enough cushion, hard choices show up fast.

Here’s the move:
→ Build your model with margin for delays
→ Track burn weekly not monthly
→ Know your true cash out date, not just your forecast
→ Make the cuts before you feel the panic
→ Keep a plan ready to stretch 90 more days if needed

Cash control isn’t about being cautious.
It’s how you stay in the driver’s seat when things get real.

Founders who stay sharp with cash
move faster, raise better, and recover quicker.

Christian Watting,christian-wattig,inspiration,7350894443354308609,2025-07-15 14:30:08.31,"Why I was promoted three times in five years

My heart pounded against my ribs as I walked down the fluorescent-lit hallway. 

My destination: the office of the Finance Director at Procter & Gamble's European headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. 

I was in my fourth year as an FP&A Analyst, and everything hinged on this conversation. 

Just a few days earlier, I'd approached her – not for the first time – about getting transferred to the U.S. 

You see, my wife, an American, had tried to learn German, but it was clear that building a career and truly feeling at home would be incredibly difficult for her. 

Procter & Gamble, a US-based company, was known for its internal transfers, often coupled with promotions. 

So, full of hope, I pushed open her office door. 

The moment our eyes met, my hopeful anticipation crumbled into a pit in my stomach. 

Her expression wasn't one of congratulations. It was one of… disappointment.

""Look,"" she began, her voice measured, ""I put in a good word for you with my colleagues overseas. But the thing is, your performance rating just isn't good enough to justify a transfer.""

It was hard to hear anything after that. 

My mind reeled. A 4 out of 5 was a great rating, wasn't it? I thought I was doing well. 

But what I didn't know then was the unwritten rule: to be considered for promotion or an international transfer, you needed a 5 out of 5. I didn't have that. 

I wasn't good enough.

The next day, still reeling, I sat down with my manager. I needed to understand. What was I missing?

It felt like a gut punch: ""Your impact in the broader business is limited,"" he said. 

My cross-functional business partners didn't see me as a trusted advisor.

And in a company like Procter & Gamble, demonstrating that strategic influence was the only path to advancement.

I tried for a few months to turn it around. But eventually, I realized I couldn't. 

So, I made a tough decision. I quit my job at Procter & Gamble and moved to the States, jobless.

Fortunately, my luck changed quickly. Within four weeks, I landed a new role at Unilever.

There, I was incredibly fortunate to find two amazing mentors. 

They taught me the secrets of becoming a true strategic business partner, of building genuine influence. 

A year and a half later, I earned my first leadership role, managing a junior analyst. 

Two years after that, I was promoted again, leading a larger team of five direct reports. 

And just a year and a half after that, I was promoted to a senior leadership role, overseeing the entire Logistics Finance team, with eight direct reports across both accounting and FP&A. 

That's three promotions in less than five years, a trajectory I largely attribute to the lessons I now pass on to my students.

Not responsibility
Not accountability

Control

Letting go of being the one who checks every model
Letting go of always having the last word
Letting go of being the only person who gets it right

Early on, control was survival
You knew the numbers
You built the systems
You were the system

But as the team grows, control turns into constraint
People wait for your input
Decisions stall
Everything flows through you and only you

That’s a bottleneck

Great leaders don’t let go of standards
They let go of ownership
They build systems that work without them
They turn context into clarity
So teams can move without waiting

1. Become the business growth partner
   
Your technical skills are the bare minimum now. While you're fine-tuning reports, successful FP&A teams are co-creating strategy with sales and product teams. AI owns the reporting. Your impact comes from spotting opportunities in the noise. If you're not shaping go-to-market plans, you're just a cost center.
   
2. Unlock the hidden value drivers
   
Your metrics are surface-level. While you're tracking standard KPIs, AI can reveal unexpected correlations that drive profitability. Stop measuring what everyone else measures. Your company needs insights nobody else has found. Every conventional analysis is a missed opportunity to discover your unique growth formula. Tomorrow's FP&A teams create proprietary intelligence advantages.
   
3. Own the AI-powered insights revolution
   
Your forecasting process is outdated. While you're debating assumptions in budget meetings, AI is already spotting patterns you'll miss. Stop hiding behind ‘that's how we've always done it.’ Your CEO doesn't need another budget vs actual report. They need you to turn data into decisions. Every manual forecast you create is another reminder you're playing catch-up.
   
4. Master financial psychology
   
Your analysis ignores human behavior. While you're crunching numbers, AI can decode the emotional patterns driving financial decisions. Stop pretending markets are purely rational. Your models need to factor in fear, greed, and bias. Every forecast that ignores psychology is fundamentally flawed. Next-gen FP&A teams blend behavioral science with financial analysis to predict what others can't see.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7349209055871062016,2025-07-10 22:53:00.621,"The WSJ recently covered the chaos of private equity recruiting — offers made before analysts even start their jobs, speed-dating interviews that stretch into the early morning, and new bank policies threatening termination for early commitments.

It’s a complex issue.

Yes, it feels ethically murky to accept a role while already plotting your exit.

But maybe that’s not entirely bad — it helps banks identify who’s truly interested in the job versus who’s just passing through on their way to PE. The same share of analysts were going to end up in PE and not at a bank at the end of their 2 years either way.

That said, these new rules may backfire.

If top talent knows they’ll be penalized for exploring other options, they might skip the bulge brackets altogether. And with many boutiques now matching on comp and prestige, that’s a real risk.

At the end of the day, both sides are stuck in a system that doesn’t make room for long-term alignment.

And calling financial modeling “mundane”?

Let’s not even go there.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7349112299908911104,2025-07-10 16:28:32.202,"WSJ just published a piece on a truly disheartening trend: junior investment bankers abandoning their roles for private equity mere months after starting.
 
It’s offensive.
Not because of the ethics.
Not because of the recruiting wars.
But because…

They dared to call financial modeling and spreadsheet work mundane.

Excuse me??

As a proud Excel jockey, I’m here to say:
Those aren’t mundane tasks.
They are the sacred arts.
Crafted in the temple of Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
Refined over weekends, caffeine, and conditional formatting.

Now that we’ve addressed that criminal insult…

The article’s really about the increasingly chaotic world of PE recruiting:
Offers before day one.
Speed dating interviews that go until 3 a.m.
Policies threatening to fire analysts who accept roles at other firms too early.

I’ve worked with analysts on both sides of this. And honestly? I get it.

Private equity offers more prestige, significantly higher upside, and a seat closer to the action.

And banks? They’re burning out the very talent they rely on, only to be shocked when that talent walks.

But it’s a complex issue.

On one hand, it does feel a bit unethical to accept a job and immediately start planning your exit — especially when your current firm is investing in your development.

On the other hand, maybe this actually helps:
If someone’s determined to walk to PE, better to know early.
It clears the runway for folks who truly want to do investment banking.

Still, I wouldn’t be surprised if these new anti-poaching policies backfire.
Analysts may just skip the bulge brackets entirely — and head straight to boutiques, which are already catching up on prestige and comp.

We can joke about spreadsheets all day — but the tension here is real.

Curious to hear:
If you're on the recruiting or analyst side of this, have things truly cooled down?
Or is it just a new spin on the same madness?

Not catching them before you hit ""send"".

Fortunately, there is a way to make finding errors in Excel straightforward:

Following financial modeling standards, such as:

1. Workbook Design 
   --> Separate sheets for Inputs, Calculations, Control.
   --> Calculate only once.
   --> Use consistent sign conventions.
   
2. Worksheet Design
   --> Each column has one purpose.
   --> Don't interrupt formula consistency.
   --> Display time periods horizontally
   
3. Formulas
   --> Use one formula per row that is copied across.
   --> Keep formulas shorter than your thumb.
   --> Split complex calculations.
   
4. Quality Control
   --> Checks near corresponding calculations.
   --> Link to master control sheet on all tabs.
   --> Include a sensitivity alert.

But:

Modeling standards don't apply in every situation.
You must know when to break the rules.

And you can only successfully do that if you know WHY the standards exist.

That's where my FREE Financial Modeling course comes in:

It walks you through the most important standards via a series of short videos.

And, crucially, it includes a best practice model template that you can download for Excel. It demonstrates how each standard is intended to be used, making their purpose crystal clear.

Not because I got everything wrong
But because the small misses compounded fast.

Here’s what I’d do from day one:

→ Build systems before scaling reports
Dashboards don’t fix broken inputs.
Start with clean data, one logic, and one source of truth.

→ Set the reporting cadence early
Without rhythm, finance becomes reactive.
Monthly reviews. Weekly flash. Rolling forecasts.
Make consistency non-negotiable.

→ Say no faster
Early on, I said yes to too much.
To be helpful. To stay liked.
But clarity always beats consensus.

→ Separate noise from signal
Not every metric needs airtime.
Not every variance needs a meeting.
Only chase what moves the business.

→ Block time for deep work
You don’t find clarity in back-to-back meetings.
The best calls I’ve helped shape started with 90 minutes of focused thinking—alone.

You don’t need to be perfect.
But you do need a foundation that scales.

- Delayed business insights
- Reactive vs strategic planning
- Fragmented data across systems
- Endless spreadsheet reconciliations
- 75% of time wasted on manual processing

This limits strategic value and analyst potential.

Here's how to fix this:

1. Ruthless prioritization
   
Focus on high-value analysis. FP&A teams spend 75% of their time on data gathering and only 25% on actual analysis. Transform this ratio to drive better decisions.
   
Create a value-impact scorecard for every recurring task.
   
2. Automate core reports
   
The average finance team spends over 180 hours annually on manual reporting. Start with your most frequent reports to reclaim this time.
   
Track hours saved monthly to build case for more automation.
   
3. Real-time data integration
   
64% of high-performing FP&A teams now rely on integrated data for decision-making, up 12% from the previous year. By 2030, up to 30% of current manual hours could be automated.
   
Start with your most frequently accessed data sources.
   
4. Data-driven decision making
   
Companies with advanced analytics capabilities are 2.5x more likely to make faster decisions than their peers. Focus on building repeatable analysis frameworks and creating clear decision trees for common scenarios.
   
Start with your top 3 most frequent business decisions and create templates.

Does the word send shivers down your spine?
Remind you of the SATs?
Or worse — your next doctor’s appointment?

It’s what I call the first phase of my work with PE-backed companies.
A finance assessment — quick, focused, and built to accelerate.

It’s 2–3 weeks of hands-on work:
Mapping where finance stands today, where it needs to go, and what it will take to get there — without overwhelming the team.

But I get why the word assessment can sound… invasive.

This week, a CEO asked me:
➝ “Are you functioning as a diligence provider for the acquirer?”

And that made it click.

They weren’t just asking when I come in — pre-close or post-close.
➝ They were trying to figure out why.
➝ “Are you here to help me… or evaluate me?”

A fair question. Especially if your investors brought me in.
Especially if I called it an assessment.

So let me be clear:
➝ I don’t do diligence.
➝ It’s not an exam.
➝ And I’m definitely not a proctologist.

Whether I come in pre- or post-close, the work is the same:
Helping leadership align, build a plan, and scale without breaking the back office.

They won’t give you perfect forecasts by next week.

Clarity.
Discipline.
Momentum.

They build structure where there was none.
They turn vague runway guesses into real timelines.
They stop the last-minute board panic.
They give your team a rhythm that holds.

→ A reporting system that runs without daily check-ins
→ A plan for cash that’s more than just “watching burn”
→ Metrics that the whole team can align around
→ A clean model that forces clarity in your assumptions

Here’s what you shouldn’t expect:
→ Instant dashboards
→ Magic insights from messy data
→ A one-person army

Scenario Planning Example:

than ours. The impact on the business would be a drop of 30% of our revenues in the

1. Why do we need 15 approvals for a $5K spend?
   
Beyond standard overhead. Smart CFOs want FP&A to quantify the cost of being complicated. Why do we need 15 approvals for a $5K spend? What's the real price of running 27 different commission structures? When FP&A measures process bloat, they expose millions in hidden costs. Too many FP&A teams accept complexity as necessary.
   
Each ‘special case’ process isn't just extra work. It's a $500K annual tax on efficiency.
   
2. Which metrics are we too afraid to track?
   
Not just safe dashboards. CFOs need FP&A to quantify the unspoken disasters. What's the dollar impact of our ‘consensus culture’ that delays every decision by 3 months? How much do we lose letting underperforming executives keep their vanity projects? Most FP&A teams avoid career-limiting metrics. But CFOs want the numbers that expose institutional blind spots.
   
Politics costs more than payroll. Track the real expense of avoiding hard conversations.
   
A 20-person meeting repeated weekly isn't collaboration, it's a $2M annual performance tax.
   
3. Where are our automation investments failing?
   
Not just ROI calculations. CFOs want FP&A to expose where digital transformation actually creates new costs. Why did our AI project need 5 new hires to manage it? Are we really saving money with that new system, or just shifting costs? When FP&A tracks total impact, they prevent expensive mistakes.
   
A $2M software system isn't savings if it creates $3M in new process costs.
   
LESSON

FP&A isn't just monitoring budgets.

Innovation isn't just new technology.

1. The insight to see hidden patterns
2. The courage to challenge popular initiatives

- Culture that treats questioning as disloyalty.
- Budgets built to tick boxes, not make moves.
- Business partners who only show up at QBRs.
- Headcount debates with no business context.
- Reorgs labeled ‘strategic’ that gut FP&A visibility.
- ‘Bottom-up planning’ that’s top-down in disguise.
- Roadmaps sold as certainty when no one believes them.

- A model simple enough to argue with.

(research-based)

1. Build mental models

Think of mental models as your internal map for understanding financial systems. They help you predict how changes in one area affect the whole picture. A landmark 2024 study of 1.6M analyst reports revealed that top performers use focused, forward-looking mental models to cut through complexity. These frameworks help you spot patterns, test assumptions, and make better recommendations with less effort.

2. Expose data weaknesses

Data is the backbone of FP&A. But not all data is created equal. Research reveals that poor data quality costs businesses an average of 15-25% in revenue loss. Learn to spot inconsistencies and validate sources. FP&A teams with strong data validation processes show 40% higher forecast accuracy.

3. Master emotional control

In FP&A, pressure and tough conversations are daily. Mastering emotional control means staying calm and clear-headed when stakes are high. Research shows analysts with strong emotional intelligence make better risk decisions and handle complex situations more effectively. A 2024 study links high EI to superior financial performance, particularly in high-pressure environments.

4. Prioritization & Time management

Juggling multiple requests is a daily reality. Focus on what drives value. Use the Eisenhower Matrix: urgent vs. important. Prioritize tasks that influence strategic goals rather than just chasing urgent distractions. This skill reduces burnout and boosts effectiveness.

5. Tech fluency + Adaptability

Excel skills are just the start. Be ready to learn new tools, Power BI, Python, or automation platforms. Research from McKinsey shows that analysts who adapt quickly to tech changes outperform peers and save hours weekly by automating repetitive tasks.

And there is a lot more to it than collecting and consolidating budget inputs once a year.

The five major FP&A planning tasks are:

1. Long-range Planning
2. Target Setting
3. Forecasting
4. Annual Budgeting
5. External Guidance

My one-pager explains what success looks like for each task.

But annual budgeting is undoubtedly the ""crown discipline"" of planning for FP&A.

Why? Because finance has to lead the process from start to finish. 

And when it's done right, it's a significant time investment for all senior leaders in the company, so a lot hinges on it being managed well.

A common problem for finance is that annual budgeting gets hectic and stressful when people wait until the very last minute to submit their inputs.

📌 That's why I created a FREE mini-course with best practices for setting budget timelines.

You'll learn:

• The critical things you must do BEFORE starting the budgeting process if you want to make it effective 

• How to use the RACI ownership structure framework to assign clear roles and responsibilities to everyone involved 

• Setting budget timelines that guarantee you get your inputs on time using the Staggered Timeline method

1. You question every headline

When someone says sales are up, your instinct is, Against what baseline? You need trends, seasonality, and context before you believe the hype. Data without depth feels hollow.

2. You’re the actually… in the room

While others celebrate targets, you're adjusting for one-offs, FX shifts, or timing noise. You bring the reality check quietly, precisely, and without drama. It is not always praised, but it is always necessary.

3. You care more about the 'why' than the 'what.'

Revenue jumped? You are already breaking down segments, challenging assumptions, and checking the funnel. You never settle for surface-level answers.

4. You find peace in reconciliation

 When numbers tie out perfectly, it feels right. You have caught big mistakes just because something felt 0.2% off. It is not about being picky. It is about instinct.

5. You simplify complexity fast

You take a messy model or a chaotic business update and turn it into a 3-bullet summary. FP&A is not just about building models. It is about making the business make sense.

You chase signals, not noise. 
You explain the “why” behind the “what.”

was already working for you at year 1?

Most firms wait until they go to market to build a real data cube.

It’s always the same:
→ Rushed. 
→ Patchy. 
→ Hard to explain.

And by then, it’s too late to actually use it.

But the same cube private equity wants to see at exit?

It’s the same one that could have helped you price smarter, fix margin earlier, and scale faster.

So I built it.

A 10-year financial operating model for a fictional advisory firm:
→ Weekly time tracking
→ Headcount and FTE
→ Discounting, realization, utilization
→ Revenue built from the ground up

Not scraped. Not benchmarked.
Simulated.
Row by row. Week by week. 28,000 rows in total.

It’s the model I wish more firms had at year 1 — not year 5.
Not because it makes the exit cleaner (which it does).
Because it makes the journey better.

There’s more to build.
Projects. Promotions. COGS. Profitability by practice.
But the foundation is here.

Wanting to be seen as “strategic” is a good instinct.
But too many CFOs overcorrect.

They try to say yes to everything.
They chase every project.
They step into chaos—without creating clarity.

Here’s where it breaks:

→ Saying yes too quickly
Support doesn’t mean agreement.
Smart CFOs slow the conversation down and ask better questions.

→ Chasing projects without trade-offs
If everything’s a priority, nothing is.
Great operators think in constraints—finance should too.

→ Trying to control more instead of clarifying more
CFOs shouldn’t hold the reins tighter.
They should make sure everyone knows which direction we’re actually pulling.

→ Confusing speed with leadership
You don’t have to be in every room to be effective.
You just have to design the system that keeps things moving.

Good operators simplify.
Great CFOs create the space for that to happen.

Great CFOs don’t just manage the budget.
They build the system behind good decisions.

Here’s what sets them apart:

→ They validate assumptions, not just numbers
A clean model is useless if the logic behind it is wrong.
Good finance starts with pressure testing the story.

→ They forecast based on business velocity, not calendar dates
Some companies need daily updates. Others monthly.
They match the rhythm to the reality.

→ They align finance with operations
The numbers don’t matter if the team can’t act on them.
Great CFOs speak both languages.

→ They translate data into action
Dashboards are easy.
Turning them into decisions is where the work is.

→ They use variance analysis as a strategy tool
It’s not about “what went wrong.”
It’s about what needs to change.

→ They always plan for “what if”
Every scenario. Every risk.
Because the unexpected always shows up.

It’s about clarity, agility, and momentum.

But if FP&A is buried in finance, its true value isn't seen.

It all comes down to how leadership views FP&A:

Operational?

If FP&A is just about spreadsheets and reports, keeping it under finance makes sense.

Strategic?

If FP&A drives decisions, aligns resources, and fuels growth, it must operate as a peer to the business.

Finance tracks costs. FP&A drives decision-making.

Finance manages budgets. FP&A fuels strategy.

Most FP&A teams are trapped in a cycle of irrelevance.

The business moves forward without them.

Critical decisions happen in rooms they're not invited to.

Their insights arrive three weeks too late.

This isn't just inefficient.

It's dangerous.

So, FP&A needs to prove its value.

Not through prettier spreadsheets.

But through better business outcomes.

Start here:

Stop money-pit projects before they drain resources

Turn customer complaints into revenue forecasts.

Make competitors' SEC filings your playbook.

Translate market rumors into financial scenarios.

Show what the board isn't asking about but should be.

Make data tell stories that change decisions.

Own the metrics that matter, not just the ones that exist.

→ But they don’t have the mindset

3. A one-line insight beats 20 slides.

4. Every number hides a story; find it.

5. Bad news early saves disasters later.

6. No one thanks you for preventing fires.

7. Focus on the outcomes, not on outputs.

8. Precision is overrated; direction matters.

9. FP&A defines metrics, not chases them.

10. Most teams focus on outputs, not outcomes.

11. PowerPoint doesn’t build trust; judgment does.

12. Templates save time; questions uncover truth.

13. Forecasts are never right, but they must be useful.

14. Good FP&A saves money; great FP&A drives momentum.

15. Budgets are guesses; accountability makes them work.

16. Clean numbers hide dirty realities; FP&A lives in between.

17. Finance reports facts; FP&A changes them for the better.

18. FP&A sees risks first and absorbs blame last; it’s lonely work.

19. Your first instinct is to cut costs; your better instinct is to fix resource allocation instead.

20. The best analysis isn’t flashy. It’s the one that stops a bad decision quietly and effectively.

21. Incentives drive behavior, and FP&A spots misalignment first, then fixes it when no one else will.

22. Real value isn’t in the model. It’s in fixing assumptions no one else wants to challenge but must be corrected anyway.

23. Most people miss the story behind every number, but FP&A has to find it and act on it to drive change across the business.

24. No function understands the business end-to-end like FP&A, and that makes you indispensable and overworked at the same time.

You don’t need a finance degree.
You need discipline.

Because most financial problems don’t start big.
They start small, then compound quietly.

Founders get busy.
Teams move fast.
And the numbers?
They usually lag behind the decisions.

These four questions keep you ahead of the curve:

1. What’s driving burn?

→ Burn isn’t the number that matters most. It’s the rate of change inside it.
→ Are we scaling headcount too soon?
→ Has CAC crept up while no one’s watching?
→ Are we paying for tools we don’t use?

Your runway doesn’t just depend on revenue.
It depends on how fast the money goes out and why.

2. What could break our margin?
→ Margins don’t implode overnight. 
They erode one discount, one vendor creep, one ops miss at a time.

→ Are we maintaining price integrity?
→ Are costs growing faster than revenue?
→ Is customer success driving retention or just delaying churn?

Margins are what make growth sustainable.
Ignore them, and you scale yourself into a corner.

3. Are we investing ahead of growth or behind it?
→ Are we being proactive or reactive?
→ Are we hiring to hit plan or to fix a team that’s already overwhelmed?
→ Are we spending for what’s coming or what’s on fire?

The best finance leaders don’t just pace growth.
They shape it with intent.

4. If revenue stalled today, how long could we survive?
→ This is the one most people avoid. But it’s the one that matters when the market tightens.

→ What if fundraising takes six months longer?
→ What if a big customer churns?
→ What if sales slows but costs don’t?

Runway isn’t about panic.
It’s about control.

It’s what lets you operate from confidence, not desperation.

You don’t need 50 dashboards.
You need four questions on repeat.

Ask them.
Answer them.
And adjust early.

Christian Watting,christian-wattig,inspiration,7343284299678248960,2025-06-24 14:30:08.668,"Don't make this FP&A mistake:

Sharing your performance review report immediately after the month-end close is done.

Why?

It doesn't give you enough time to uncover what caused variances and what to do about it.

To get there, you need to dig into operational data and collaborate with your cross-functional business partners.

And that takes time.

So, I recommend you do what my former teams at Unilever, P&G, and Squarespace have been doing for a long time:

Submit a ""Flash Report"" immediately after the close that highlights variances between actuals and expectations (= prior forecast, budget, and prior year). The goal is to point out the misses and which business  teams are responsible for investigating them.

Then, 10-15 days later, have a detailed ""Performance Review"" meeting.

Today's one-pager breaks down how to structure the Flash Report. Tomorrow, I will cover the Performance Review.

📌 And if you want to see an example of a fully built-out Flash Report and learn much more about financial reporting best practices:

Take a look at my brand new course ""Reporting & Financial Storytelling""

Inside the course, you’ll learn how to:

• Discover what reports to create
• Create the optimal structure for each report
• Handpick financial insights that make a difference
• Avoid the most common reporting mistakes
• Create visualizations that bring the financials to life
• Present in a way that incentivizes the right actions
• And much more  

As with the six FP&A courses we’ve launched before this one, the above happens through bite-sized, professionally recorded video lessons you can cover at your own pace. ​

You also get exercises, real-life case studies, and templates that ensure you can apply what you learn in your unique circumstances. 

​In a nutshell, you get a comprehensive guide for creating insightful financial reports fast and on time… ​

Plus, everything you need to present these insights in a way that gets leaders to act.

Nathan Saperia,nathansaperia,inspiration,7343272583796023298,2025-06-24 13:43:35.384,"COGS is a great KPI. But if that’s the first one you mention, we’ve got a problem.

I heard someone at an accounting conference say it was their top KPI—no hesitation.

And I’ll be honest: I bristled.

Because COGS isn’t actionable. It doesn’t tell you what lever to pull. It just tells you what happened.

But then I stepped back.

COGS **is** a good KPI. Especially in people businesses.
It’s fundamental. Necessary in indicating performance. Just not… sufficient.

And maybe the issue isn’t COGS.
Maybe it’s me using #KPI as shorthand for something else.

Because in strategic finance, we’ve already moved past KPIs.
We look at drivers. Levers. Actionable metrics.

The stuff you can change or use to change outcomes- your financial KPIs.

Meanwhile, many accounting firms are just now embracing financial KPIs—and that’s progress. But they haven’t yet moved into operational KPIs, let alone the kind of actionable metrics needed to guide performance in real time.

And here’s the tension: advisory services require exactly that.

You can’t advise strategically if all your metrics are backward-looking. You can’t help clients shape outcomes if you’re only measuring them after the fact.

But many firms are trying to leap from compliance work straight into advisory—without realizing how big the capability gap really is.

That gap isn’t just about tools. It’s about mindset, measurement, and the ability to operate in ambiguity.

KPI stands for “Key Performance Indicator.”
But let’s be honest—half the time it really means “Kinda Passive Insight.”

So yes—COGS is a good KPI.
But if it’s the only KPI in the room?

You’re not doing #Advisory.
You’re just reporting, with slightly fancier words.

So what do you think—should we retire the term entirely?

“I love to put together a 50-page slide deck every month.”

“Yeah, and I can’t wait to read each and every one of them.”

Said no one ever.

Yet, preparing comprehensive decks to report company performance is still the norm at most firms.

But, there’s an alternative:

One-Pagers.

Procter & Gamble and Amazon fully embrace them.

When I was at P&G, the GM I worked with refused to look at any deck or document unless it fit on one page.

Similarly, a friend told me that when he started a new job at Amazon, he was confused about why no one would say anything at the beginning of a big meeting.

People would just sit there with their heads down.

That’s because they all read the One Pager at the beginning of each decision meeting.

Here are the pros of One-Pagers:

• Summarizing evolves thinking
• More efficient use of meeting time
• Easier reference post-launch
• Less time-consuming to prepare

But of course, there are also disadvantages:

• Space constraints can be limiting
• Harder to control the message
• Harder to show the thought process

But why? 

So it's not just about forecasting. 

But FP&A teams turn financial chaos into clarity.

They're the first to see risks but often the last to be heard.

And yet, they're

- Blamed when things go wrong
- Overlooked when things go right
- Given deadlines that are unrealistic
- Told to make it happen, no matter the cost
- Expected to be available 24/7, no questions asked

While 90% of employees perform better with recognition.
And 92% deliver stronger results when appreciated...
FP&A remains undervalued.

Still treated like an afterthought.

FP&A deserves:

A better work-life balance.
A seat at the strategy table.
Recognition beyond month-end.
Tools that actually work for them.
Career paths that go beyond Excel.

Christian Watting,christian-wattig,inspiration,7342197140242284544,2025-06-21 14:30:09.66,"It's a HUGE mistake not to prepare a top-down and a bottom-up plan during the budgeting process and subsequent forecast updates.

Here is why:

Both types of plans are biased.

The bottom-up plan is prepared by the budget owners who have to deliver it. They are incentivized to lower leadership expectations by submitting low plans for sales coupled with high asks for budget.

And the top-down approach is done by finance or senior leaders. They want to challenge the team to do more with less and are typically too far removed from the day-to-day to take nuances into account.

This is what you should do instead:

Create a detailed top-down plan and then discuss the differences with the bottom-up plan with the budget owners. The resulting ""compromise"" will have a higher accuracy than each plan alone.

But that's not the biggest advantage of preparing both types of plans:

Even more important than the accuracy of the budget is the opportunity to challenge assumptions and identify risks and opportunities. 

If you come armed with a detailed top-down plan, then the discussions with budget owners will be data-based and more fruitful.

Download the one-pager for more information about this.

Another common problem for finance is that annual budgeting gets hectic and stressful when people wait until the very last minute to submit their inputs.

📌 That's why I created a FREE mini-course with best practices for setting budget timelines.

You'll learn:

• The critical things you must do BEFORE starting the budgeting process if you want to make it effective  

• How to use the RACI ownership structure framework to assign clear roles and responsibilities to everyone involved  

• Setting budget timelines that guarantee you get your inputs on time using the Staggered Timeline method

Looks small.

Until you're forced to make a big call.

A cash flow model tells you what’s happening now.
→ Inflows. Outflows. Burn. Runway.

It helps you manage liquidity.
It gives you a view of risk if nothing changes.

But a decision model is built to test change.
→ Can we afford to open a new market?
→ Should we delay hiring until conversion improves?
→ What happens if churn creeps up two points?

A cash flow model keeps the lights on.
A decision model tells you if it’s time to build a bigger house.
Or if it’s time to protect what you already have.

One tracks performance.
The other shapes it.

And that difference matters.
Because most founders and operators stop at tracking.
They build models that show them where they are.
But not what they should do next.

A decision model starts with a real question.
Then it maps the trade-offs.
It forces clarity on assumptions.
It shows the range of outcomes before the money moves.

But knowing what’s likely to happen when they change.

The PE consulting market is shifting — fast.

Big 4 and MBB are building dedicated teams focused on strategic finance and the Office of the CFO.

The logic makes sense on paper. PE firms want more specialized, high-impact support. And who better than the Big 4 or MBB? Remember ""nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey""?

But here’s the issue: this work lives in a weird in-between zone.

It’s not pure accounting. It’s not classic strategy. It’s operator work — financial operators, to be specific.

That’s where most of these firms stumble.

🧮 Big 4:
They’ve got armies of accountants and controllers. But the mindset that thrives in OCFO work is anti-accounting:
 → It's scenario-based, not rules-based
 → It rewards flexibility and creativity, not rigid GAAP application
 → And ironically, many of the best strategic finance pros don’t want a Big 4 brand on their resume — it actually hurts their positioning if they want to be seen as value creators

🧠 MBB:
They’ve got the brains. No doubt. But can they shift from “strategist” to “operator”? That’s a much taller order.
 → Rolling up sleeves isn't just a metaphor — it’s the job
 → And let’s talk about pricing. OCFO support can’t command classic strategy rates. Will MBB play ball on that?

Here’s the part no one likes to admit:
 → You can’t build this with homegrown talent
 → You can’t train your way into credibility in this space
 → You have to buy your way in — fast. That may mean acquihiring. Paying up for people who’ve done it before, and letting them drive.

And that’s why firms like Accordion, Riveron, and CrossCountry aren’t scrambling to break in —
 → They already hold the high ground
 → They’ve built the teams, earned PE trust, and developed muscle memory doing this work across hundreds of portcos
 → New entrants aren’t leading a charge — they’re trying to climb a hill that’s already been fortified

If your firm is trying to break into OCFO advisory — don’t underestimate how different this work really is.

I’ve helped teams build it. And I’ve seen what happens when they assume it’s just “accounting, but faster.”

Let’s not make that mistake again.

It’s officially a part of the top 100 cohort-based courses on Maven, alongside some of the best educators on the platform.

After more than a decade in FP&A leadership roles, I fell in love with teaching.

And the FP&A Bootcamp was my first ever course. 

It launched in 2022 as a series of five live workshops, taught online via Zoom.

It came from a deeper mission:

To help finance professionals and business leaders who don’t have a great mentor like I had, master the essential skills of Financial Planning & Analysis.

Since then, I have taught 24 cohorts and improved the program every time.

More than 550 finance professionals and business leaders completed FP&A Bootcamp and have:

• Mastered essential FP&A skills in just 3 weeks
  
• Practiced what they learned in a series of interactive live workshops
  
• Made meaningful connections with peers
  
Two years ago, the success of the course enabled me to pursue my dream of becoming a full-time educator, so I’m incredibly grateful to my students and the team at Maven.

What makes the FP&A Bootcamp different?

• You’ll learn the same content I teach as the Director of the Wharton School’s FP&A Certificate program
  
• You learn technical skills like financial modeling and forecasting AND interpersonal skills like relationship building and telling the financial story of the business
  
• You gain access to a community of peers for ongoing support and insights.
  
• The course includes bonus materials like 19 handouts and free access to a self-paced edition
  
• You get lifetime access to all course content, recordings, and bonuses.
  
If you’ve been curious, now’s a great time to join:

• The Maven 100 sale runs June 16–22
• 20% off (automatically applied)
• We kick off with the first workshop on August 14
  
👉 If you're ready to master FP&A and drive business impact, Maven is offering 20% off until Sunday:

🕗 But headcount? Flat.
🧠 And strategy? Missing.

A WSJ article today confirms what most white-collar professionals already feel in their bones:
→ We’re not working longer because we love the grind.
→ We’re working longer because the actual work doesn’t start until after dinner.
🔹 Meetings after 8pm are up 16%
🔹 A third of workers are back in their inboxes by 10pm
🔹 Burnout mentions on Glassdoor just hit a 10-year high

And yet—most firms respond by slapping on another AI tool, another layer of “cross-functional collaboration,” or worse: another all-hands.

Here’s what I’m seeing inside professional services firms and PE-backed portcos:
→ Teams are drowning in complexity—while leadership focuses on utilization
→ Internal Strategic Finance is underfunded and underleveraged—because it doesn’t have billable hours
→ Workflow automation is “on the roadmap”—but 80% of core processes still run through Outlook and Excel

If you're a COO, CFO, or Managing Partner and your people are logging back on at 9pm…

You're not scaling.
You're surviving.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

🧰 Whether it's a capacity model, async communication design, or a back-office automation roadmap—there are concrete steps to bend time back in your favor.

Not a deck.
Not a gut feeling.
A model that forces clarity.

Because if it’s important enough to act on,
It’s important enough to model.

A good model doesn’t predict the future.

It shows you the levers that matter.

It helps you pressure test your instincts
Before you commit real cash or time.

In the early stage, it’s all about survival.

→ How many months of runway do we really have?
→ What if revenue slips 20 percent?
→ Can we afford this next hire or is it a risk we can’t carry?

As you grow, the questions change.
→ Which product lines are actually profitable?
→ Are we scaling headcount faster than revenue?
→ What’s driving CAC down or back up?

Later, it becomes strategic.
→ Should we raise more capital or extend runway?
→ What’s the cost of entering a new market or staying in one that’s slowing down?
→ How does this business return capital over the next five years?

No matter the stage, the model gives you discipline.

It takes fuzzy ideas and makes them testable.

It puts structure behind decisions
So you’re not relying on hope or momentum alone.

Great businesses don’t just track performance.
They model what’s next.

What decision are you modeling right now,
And what has it shown you?

 1. To succeed in FP&A, people skills matter as much as technical skills.
    
 2. Data doesn’t help leaders make better decisions. Insights do.
    
 3. To become a better business partner, think lawyer, not police officer.
    
 4. To get a seat at the decision table, start by building trust.
    
 5. When finance business partnering is a new concept, success depends on the tone from the top.
    
 6. When selecting metrics to track, start with the strategies.
    
 7. When people don’t act as you hope they would, look at incentives.
    
 8. The value provided by the annual budget directly correlates to the depth of its assumptions.
    
 9. The most important criterion for a successful financial model is its structure.
    
10. The more uncertainty in the assumptions, the simpler your financial model needs to be.

It’s not just about the numbers.
It’s not just models, dashboards, or budget variance.
It’s not just closing the books or updating the forecast.

It’s judgment.
It’s knowing when to push—and when to wait.
It’s knowing which assumptions matter—and which ones can flex.

It’s people.
It’s helping teams see trade-offs before they make the wrong call.
It’s protecting the business without losing trust.
It’s saying no—and still being invited back into the room.

It’s politics.
It’s navigating pressure from the CEO, the board, and the team—at the same time.
It’s telling the truth, even when the story isn’t ready.

It’s timing.
Because a great answer at the wrong moment can still cost you everything.

It’s communication.
Because clarity isn’t just a report—it’s a decision made faster.
And a decision made faster is a competitive edge.

It’s about knowing how to lead when no one does.

In my last newsletter, I wrote about why so many of these build-outs stall:
Misaligned incentives. No clear owner. Undervaluing what real advisory takes.

But here’s the deeper issue:
Even the firms that want to do it right often skip the most important question:
What kind of practice are we actually trying to build?
➝ Are we designing around client demand or internal talent?
➝ Are we going broad in terms of service/product offerings, or staying focused?

 ➝ Your positioning shapes your pricing power
 ➝ Your delivery model determines your margins
 ➝ Your org structure defines your scalability
 ➝ Your service design either enables—or kills—recurring revenue

As a hiring manager, I interviewed dozens of FP&A job candidates. 

Now I'm sharing my insights to help you land your FP&A dream job.

What to expect at FP&A hiring manager interviews:

• FP&A is a blend of technical and interpersonal skills, so expect questions about both.
  
• Prepare for technical questions about budgeting, forecasting, financial modeling, financial analysis, and reporting.
  
• Interpersonal skill-related questions may be about business partnering, which includes advising, challenging, and influencing others, and building relationships, or they center around financial storytelling.
  
• The most popular approach is to ask so-called “behavioral questions.” These questions begin with “tell me about a time when you did x” or “give me an example of y.” They require that you share a concrete example of your prior work experience.
  
• Behavioral questions are preferred over traditional questions such as “how would you approach situation x?” That’s because concrete examples of past performance lend themselves better to deeper follow-up questions that aim to probe beyond prepared remarks.

Download the FP&A Interview Guide one-pager to learn how to prepare for commonly asked interview questions.

As an FP&A leader with over a decade of experience, I've been on both sides of the interview table many times, so I know exactly what hiring managers are looking for when they're interviewing for FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) roles.

Prepare for these 18 questions, and even if you're asked slightly different questions, you'll be better prepared than 90% of applicants.

I just recorded a YouTube video to explain how to answer each of the questions (the link is at the end of the post).

And most of them are struggling.

Why?

Because they assume #accounting and #FPandA are adjacent — when they’re actually just complementary.

It’s not the same work.
It’s not the same mindset.
And it’s definitely not the same #talent pool.

What accounting firms see as a badge of credibility, strategic finance professionals often see as a scarlet letter — something they’ll have to explain away to avoid being seen as “just an accountant.”

We touched on this dynamic during my FP&A Today appearance, but I go deeper in today’s newsletter:

→ How firms are misreading the talent market
→ What it takes to actually compete in this space

Early-stage chaos looks a lot like scale-up complexity.

But they break for very different reasons.

In the early days, finance is about staying alive.

→ Cash flow updates every week
→ Forecasts built in Google Sheets/Excel
→ Budgets built on instinct, not infrastructure

Founders need fast answers
Even if they’re 80% right.
Speed matters more than polish.

But once the company starts scaling
Everything shifts.

You’re still making decisions fast.
But now they impact 10x more people, 10x more capital, and 10x more risk.

The problems get bigger:
→ Metrics get siloed across teams
→ Forecasts stop matching reality
→ Systems strain under headcount growth

The habits that worked at $1M ARR?
They’re usually what breaks things at $10M.

That’s where strategic FP&A makes the difference.
Not just tracking performance
But helping leadership rethink how decisions get made.

Finance leaders are frequently tasked with improving profitability through cost savings, but the real challenge often lies in finding impactful measures that don't stifle growth. 

It requires a strategic look across various functions and processes.  

Thinking beyond across-the-board cuts, optimization opportunities can be found in areas like:

• Applying rigorous budgeting techniques (like ZBB) to scrutinize ROI.  

• Analyzing marketing spend effectiveness and asset performance.  
  
• Optimizing team structures and hiring strategies.  
  
• Streamlining core support processes and considering make-or-buy decisions.  
  
• Leveraging specific tools to manage travel and expenses more effectively (where platforms such as TravelPerk can offer valuable visibility and analytics).  
  
I've compiled 21 practical cost-saving ideas into the infographic below as a source of inspiration for finance teams.

We covered:
 → Whether AI is a strategic edge or a staffing risk
 → Why BI tools fail (and how to actually drive adoption)
 → The difference between a budget and an operating plan
 → What makes a KPI worth tracking in the first place
 → How to prove ROI on FP&A transformation when leadership still trusts their gut

Not 30.
Not a dashboard packed with every possible KPI.
Just 3.

Because when everything matters, nothing moves.

Most teams don’t have a reporting problem.
They have a focus problem.

I’ve seen founders obsess over CAC, MRR, pipeline, payback...
But still miss the one number that actually tells them if they’re in trouble.

So here’s the exercise I give them:
If you had to run your business on 3 numbers—only 3—
What would they be?

No fluff.
No noise.
Just the signals that tell you if the engine is working.

For me, it usually looks like this 

→ Gross margin
Because revenue without profitability is just a distraction.
This tells you if your growth is worth the cost.

→ Cash runway
Because burn catches up faster than anyone expects.
This tells you how long you have to keep building.

→ Retention
Because new revenue is expensive.
Repeatable revenue means your product is actually working.

Those 3 don’t tell you everything.
But they force clarity.

And that’s what most teams are missing.

You don’t need more metrics.
You need better decisions.

No one tells you how easy it is to confuse clarity with intelligence.

You think your job is to be the expert in the room.
To build the most advanced model.
To spot what no one else sees.

But being the smartest doesn’t move the business forward.

Being understood does.

Because if no one can follow your logic,
They can’t act on it.

If no one sees the financial story,
They’ll keep making the wrong calls—even with the right data.

And if the team can’t repeat what you said in their own words,
You haven’t communicated. You’ve just impressed yourself.

I stopped trying to sound smart.
I started making things simple.

Not simplified.
Just clearer.

That’s when things started to click:
→ Teams made faster decisions
→ Execs aligned around fewer metrics
→ The board actually paid attention

I have led 11 annual budgeting processes in my career as an FP&A leader at P&G, Unilever, and Squarespace.

Not everyone is a fan of budgeting.

I'd argue that the pros outweigh the cons if the annual planning process is run well.

What do you think?

📌 Advantages of Annual Budgeting

1. Financial Control and Discipline
2. Coordination
3. Performance Evaluation
4. Resource Allocation
5. Managing Expectations
6. Strategic Reassessment

📌 Disadvantages of Annual Budgeting

1. Time-consuming
2. Outdated Assumptions
3. Short-term Focus
4. Potential for Gameplaying

Download the infographic for details and examples of each advantage and disadvantage of budgeting.

A common problem is that annual budgeting gets hectic and stressful when people wait until the very last minute to submit their inputs.

That's why I created a FREE mini-course with best practices for setting budget timelines.

You'll learn:

• The critical things you must do BEFORE starting the budgeting process if you want to make it effective
  
• How to use the RACI ownership structure framework to assign clear roles and responsibilities to everyone involved
  
• Setting budget timelines that guarantee you get your inputs on time using the Staggered Timeline method

Having led 11 annual budgeting processes at P&G, Unilever, and Squarespace...

I realized that each time we go through five distinct phases.

Whether the planning process is a success or a failure depends on how well you manage each of them:

📌 Phase 1: Pre Kick-Off - ""Planning the Plan""

What you should do upfront:

• Review the previous year's plan
• Create the planning roadmap
• Implement process improvements

📌 Phase 2: Joint Planning - ""Any Questions?""

Partnering with the cross-functional team:

• Business teams create the bottom-up plan
• FP&A creates the top-down plan
• Together, FP&A and business teams compare plans, discuss variances, and - crucially - assess risks and opportunities

📌 Phase 3: Consolidation - ""What's the bottom-line?""

The finance team collects inputs and creates consolidated financial statements:

• Consolidation must be fast to avoid playing catch-up with new assumptions
• Consider using a planning system instead of just Excel to drastically simplify the process

📌 Phase 4: Iteration - ""If once you don't succeed...""

Most of the time, the first round of inputs doesn't meet expectations:

• Use ranges, scenarios, and contingency plans to make adjustments quickly
• Stick to your deadlines
• Most importantly: Overcommunicate!

📌 Phase 5: Presentation & Final Alignment - ""We are all one team.""

Finance builds the deck and gets leaders on board with the plan:

• Don't just present the financials, include how strategies translate to tactics and how those will be measured
• Quantify how each strategy is likely to impact the financials
• Don't forget an executive summary that highlights the key issues that must be discussed

I know that a common problem is this:

Budgeting gets hectic and stressful when people wait until the very last minute to submit their inputs.

You'll learn:

• The critical things you must do BEFORE starting the budgeting process if you want to make it effective  

• How to use the RACI ownership structure framework to assign clear roles and responsibilities to everyone involved  

• Setting budget timelines that guarantee you get your inputs on time using the Staggered Timeline method

You can’t just focus on the P&L when it comes to tracking financial metrics.

You must also look at the balance sheet, because it can tell you a lot about how efficiently the business operates.

At first, I felt overwhelmed. There are literally hundreds of metrics to track!

But then I realized something that made it a lot easier.

All financial metrics can be grouped into only five categories!

They are:

1. Liquidity Ratios
2. Leverage Ratios
3. Efficiency Ratios
4. Profitability Ratios
5. Market Value Ratios

That’s it.

I recorded a short YouTube video to explain how this works.

No one tells you how easy it is to become your team’s biggest blocker.

You think your job is to be the decision-maker.
To review every model.
To sign off on every number.

But control doesn’t create scale.

Trust does.

Because if your team waits for you to weigh in,
They’re not operating—they’re pausing.

If every forecast needs your eyes,
It’s not a system. It’s a bottleneck.

And if the team only moves when you do,
You haven’t built finance. You’ve built dependence.

So I changed how I lead.
I stopped holding the playbook.
And started teaching the principles behind it.

That’s when everything shifted:
→ People made decisions without waiting
→ Process improved without my approval
→ Strategy moved forward while I stepped back

They build systems that outlast them.",18,9,0,27,50.00,text,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_how-to-build-a-finance-team-that-can-run-activity-7333507130731180032-03qS

And you know what?
I’m going to keep doing it here.

Not because I’m anti-flexibility.
Not because amazing finance leaders can’t work part-time.
But because the role of #CFO today is fundamentally not #Fractional.

In fact, it’s barely even singular.

Modern CFOs are expected to be:
 → Strategic partners to the CEO
 → Operators who keep the business running
 → Storytellers for the board
 → Systems experts
 → Team builders
 → Data translators
 → Industry savants
 → Risk managers
 → Capital markets pros
 → Oh, and sometimes HR and Legal too

That’s 1.5 to 2 FTEs. Minimum.

If you happen to find one person who checks every box? Congrats—you’ve found a unicorn.

And they’re going to cost you $2M a year, if you can even convince them to take your call.

So what’s the better play?

Find the 1.5x CFO.
The strategic, experienced leader who can own the function and build the team.

Then augment them.

Bring in a thought partner who levels them up—not with slide decks, but with targeted experience that fills the gaps.

For example:
→ You’ve hired a killer CFO.
→ They’ve scaled SaaS companies. 
→ They know systems, strategy, and how to lead.
Only problem? You’re a professional services firm. And they’re out of their element.

Don’t go looking for the exact same CFO with a services background.
You won’t find them. Or if you do, you’ll wait six months and overpay.

Instead:
→ Pair them with someone who’s lived in this space.
→ Who’s helped accounting firms, consulting firms, and people-based businesses scale.
→ Someone who can accelerate their ramp, pressure-test decisions, and spot pitfalls early.

That’s what I do.
I’m not a “fractional CFO.”
I’m the CFO’s thought partner.

""I don't want to look at reports. I want them to tell me what's happening.""
This scene from years ago shaped how I think about finance transformation. Too many brilliant FP&A professionals are trapped in what I call ""Scorekeeper Syndrome"" - producing reports nobody reads while executives make decisions without them.
It's not about competence. It's about mindset.
After 20+ years transforming finance functions at Coca-Cola, Expedia, GM, and beyond, I've seen the pattern: teams buried in reconciliations instead of shaping strategy. The breakthrough happens when you shift from ""what happened?"" to ""what should we do about it?""
My two cents: Finance teams that embrace strategic partnership don't just support decisions - they shape them.

A few weeks ago, I celebrated another birthday.
Another year gone.

Another reminder that we don’t get more time.

We just get to choose how we use what we have.

As a CFO, I’ve built my career tracking numbers.
But the most important metric isn’t on any financial statement.
It’s how we invest our hours.

Here’s what I’ve learned about time 

→ What you say no to defines you more than what you say yes to.
Meetings without clear outcomes.
Processes that exist because “we’ve always done it.”
Problems that should be solved by someone else.
Every minute spent here is a minute not spent moving forward.

→ Build a team stronger than yourself.
Not just to reduce your workload.
But to multiply your impact.
The best leaders don’t do more—they enable more.
When you have the right team, your time creates exponential returns.

→ Ruthlessly prioritize value drivers.
Not all revenue is equal.
Not all growth moves the needle.
Not all customers build your future.
Focus your finite hours on what actually changes the trajectory.

I love my family.
I love my work.
I love learning.
I need to relax.

None of these are optional.
All of them require intention.

As I reflect on another trip around the sun, I’m not asking myself what I want to achieve this year.

I’m asking what deserves my time.

Not just falling short. Failing to deliver the bare minimum that the sponsor expects. And more importantly, what the business needs to scale.

From the outside, it all looks the same:
→ Reporting is late
→ Insights are missing
→ Errors show up in board decks
→ Turnover is high

To the sponsor, it’s often indistinguishable from incompetence.

But those are just symptoms.

And turnover? It's not just a symptom—it's one of the clearest warning signs that something deeper is broken.

I’ve seen this from both sides—leading FP&A inside PE-backed firms, and advising dozens more from the outside.

And here’s the thing:
You can have great people in the seats… and still have bad performance.

Let's talk onions for a minute.

What does any of this have to do with an onion you ask? Let's start peeling away.

I was once brought in to fix a reporting model nicknamed “The Onion.”

Why “The Onion”?
Because it had so many layers to peel back.
→ 100 tabs.
→ 1,000 hard-codes.
And every layer you peeled back just made you cry more.

This Frankenstein spreadsheet had been handed down from one FP&A lead to the next—just one example of how good people inherit broken systems like a game of hot potato. (Or hot onion.)

Was it the fault of the last person holding it?
Absolutely not.

Did they still get blamed when things broke?
Absolutely.

The real issue wasn’t the analyst.
It was the environment.
→ Institutional knowledge walked out the door
→ Legacy systems hadn’t kept up
→ The team was buried in reactive tasks
→ No one had time to step back and fix the root

So if your finance team isn’t hitting the mark, don’t jump to conclusions.

Start with these questions:
💬 What expectations were set?
⚙️ What systems are they working with?
📉 What’s actually getting in their way?

Because “underperforming” teams are usually just overwhelmed—by the environment, not a lack of skill.

I’ve helped teams peel back the layers and get to the root cause. And yes, sometimes it involves a little crying along the way.

Yet founders still repeat the same mistakes:

→ Overcomplicating with endless line items. 
More detail doesn’t build trust, it breeds confusion.

→ Painting a perfect picture. 
Projections that only go up and to the right ignore reality.

Investors care about a few key numbers that tell the real story:

→ Cash Runway 
How long can you operate without funding? 
Investors fund growth—not survival.

→ Breakeven Point
When do you become self-sustaining? 
This answer signals maturity.

→ Use of Funds
Where is the money going—and why? 
“Growth” isn’t enough—name the levers.

To stand out, focus on these principles:

Prioritize Drivers
→ Identify the 3-5 metrics that move your business (CAC, churn, LTV).

Plan for Scenarios
→ Show Base, Best, and Worst Cases. This isn’t doubt—it’s preparedness.

Simplify Ruthlessly
→ If an investor can’t grasp your model in minutes, it’s too complex.

As CFO, that's not just a wish. 
It’s a financial strategy.

It’s not about taking less.

It’s about building something mathematically unstoppable.

Great finance leaders don’t just manage costs.

They engineer growth engines.

Here’s what happens when your sales team outearns the CFO:

1. You create a compensation structure that drives the right behaviors.
→ Commission models that reward profitable growth, not just volume.
→ Incentives tied directly to cash flow, not vanity metrics.
→ Performance triggers that balance short-term wins with long-term foundation.

The numbers don’t lie—when sales makes more, the business makes more.

2. You build financial predictability through sales excellence.
→ A revenue stream you can forecast with confidence.
→ A pipeline you can bank strategic decisions on.
→ A team motivated to bring in the deals that actually matter to the P&L.

3. You demonstrate what finance is really about.
→ While others see CFOs as cost controllers.
→ While competitors treat finance as the “no” department.
→ While other finance leaders obsess over their own compensation.

The best CFOs don’t need to be the highest earners.

They need to be the best architects of sustainable growth.

They don’t create finance functions that limit.

They create models that accelerate.

These seven words have killed more financial transformation than any budget cut.

Trapped more CFOs in the past than any legacy system.

And kept finance teams reporting history instead of shaping the future.

Here's what happens when this thinking takes over finance 

→ FP&A becomes backward-looking.

Teams produce the same reports quarter after quarter.

They track lagging indicators instead of leading ones.

They measure what happened instead of influencing what comes next.

→ Finance stays in the back office.
While the business needs financial partners.

While decisions are made without data.

While opportunities slip through the cracks.

→ Manual processes drain all the energy.
Month-end close takes 15 days instead of 5.

Forecasts are 85% accurate when they could be 99%.

Teams waste days building spreadsheets instead of insights.

The most dangerous phrase in finance isn't ""we missed our numbers.""

It's ""we've always closed the books this way.""
Great finance leaders don't preserve processes.

They preserve financial integrity.

They don't protect systems.

They protect business visibility.

And they know that sometimes the most innovative thing a CFO can do is break the finance function before the market breaks the business.

 It’s managing expectations.

Because saying “no” is easy.

Saying “no” without losing trust; that’s the work.


You’ll say no to a lot of things in this role

→ A big hire when the timing’s off

→ A budget increase that doesn’t align

→ A forecast that looks good on paper but breaks under scrutiny

It’s to build conviction through clarity.

Here’s how I do it

→ Show the tradeoff
 Don’t say, “We can’t afford this.”

 Say, “We can do this, but here’s what we’re giving up.”

 Make the invisible visible.

 Shift the conversation from approval to choice.

→ Offer alternatives
 Sometimes it’s not a no.

 It's “not like this.”

→ Start with a contractor instead of a full-time hire.

→ Phase the spend across two quarters instead of one.

 The best finance decisions aren’t rejections.

 They’re redesigns.

→ Make it a shared decision

 Ask: “What’s your real priority here?”

 Bring the other person into the tradeoff.

 Not to shift responsibility, but to build alignment.

 When people help shape the answer, they’re more likely to trust it.

 The hardest part of this job isn’t the math.

 It’s protecting the plan without eroding the partnership.

 If you lead with clarity and respect, the “no” becomes a door, not a wall.

It’s what Jayson Tatum must be going through.

He’s probably out for the playoffs. Maybe longer. The Celtics’ hope for a repeat championship are likely dashed. And while that changes everything for the team, it changes much more for him.

The physical pain is real. But the emotional weight? That might be heavier. The pressure, the visibility, the grief of watching from the sidelines while knowing your window is short.

Athletes live with that fragility in the spotlight. Their setbacks unfold in front of millions. Ours usually don’t.

And that’s part of the point.

You probably have a colleague or friend who’s going through something hard right now—and you’d never know. A career detour. A personal loss. A rough stretch that hasn’t let up.

Watching this happen made me pause. It’s not the same as what any of us face, but it still reminded me how quickly things can change. And how quietly some people carry heavy things.

but not because they earned it.

If you're being pitched by one, heads up: a title upgrade is coming.

Here comes the rise of the Fractional Operating Partner.

And it's not backed by new skills—just higher pricing.

Many of my former colleagues have become real #OperatingPartners and I have huge respect for that.

It's an elite role and something they should be proud of. It takes blood, sweat, and tears to get there and to stay there.

This post isn’t about them.

It’s about the rebranders.

First, Controllers became “Fractional CFOs.”
Why? Because CFOs charge more.

Now? The next evolution is here:
“Fractional Operating Partner.”

Because in the comp hierarchy: Operating Partner > CFO > Controller.
New title. Higher rate. Same deliverables.

I’ve done the real work—
→ Advised PE-backed CFOs through scale.
→ Sat in the boardroom. Turned VCPs into execution.
→ I’ve had real Operating Partner conversations with PE firms.

I passed—for now.

Not because the roles weren’t compelling.
Not because the money wasn't there. Trust me, it was.
But because I saw a different path to drive value across firms, not just one.
(But hey—PE folks reading this, my number still works. 📱😉)

So when “fractional OP” starts showing up in your inbox, ask yourself:
→ Did the value-add change?
→ Or just the comp expectations?

And hey, don't judge me if you see ""Fractional Operating Partner"" in my title soon. Just know it's legit.

Because finance isn’t just about accuracy anymore.
It’s about utility, iteration, and adoption.

Most finance teams operate on a quarterly cycle:
Collect data → Build model → Share board deck → Repeat.

But that’s not how high-performing teams work.
And it’s not how high-leverage finance should work either.

A modern finance org should operate like a product team:
– Treat internal teams as customers
– Ship tools that solve real problems
– Iterate based on feedback
– Measure adoption and outcomes

That means:
 → Every forecast should tie back to decisions, not just reporting.
 → Every dashboard should answer a live business question, not just look clean.
 → Every process should reduce friction, not add bureaucracy.

And like any product, it’s never “done.”
The inputs change. 
The questions evolve. 
The users grow.
So the finance team has to ship faster, learn faster, and improve continuously.

Consulting CFOs adapted quickly, becoming strategic, data-driven leaders. But accounting CFOs—traditionally compliance-focused—are suddenly facing new pressure. To bridge the gap, many firms appointed Chief Growth Officers (CGOs), creating a new puzzle: How can two executives with very different perspectives align effectively?

In my latest newsletter, I share insights into why this alignment challenge exists—and importantly, how to resolve it.

If CAC is steady but close rates are slipping, what’s the diagnosis?

Is the problem with the SDR script? 

The product promise? 

The buyer? 

The timing?

Most finance leaders don’t know.

Because they treat GTM as a black box, and their job as reporting, not decoding.

But great CFOs go upstream.

They dig into funnel mechanics, attribution logic, sales capacity planning.

They question assumptions that go unchecked:

→ Is this CAC blended or channel-specific?

→ Are win rates consistent across segments?

→ Is growth being driven by efficiency or headcount?

They don’t just accept the forecast.

For years, portfolio company CFOs were expected to deliver real-time insights, no matter how stretched their teams were.

Now, with liquidity slowing, hold periods stretching from 4-5 years to closer to 6-7 years, and exits delayed, LPs are turning that same intensity onto the GPs themselves: 
→ Demanding consolidated dashboards 
→ Expecting real-time portfolio visibility 
→ Asking deeper, faster, more frequent questions

In my recent conversations, I’m seeing PE firms respond by thinking more proactively across the portfolio:
• Standing up fund-level reporting infrastructure
• Consolidating insights across investments
• Building the operational discipline that used to be considered a “nice to have”

Or would they finally get to the work that actually moves the business?

Here’s the truth 

Most finance teams aren’t short on talent.
They’re short on time.

→ Chasing down last-minute numbers.
→ Rebuilding reports that should be automated.
→ Answering questions that systems should already solve.

Great teams would use it to:

→ Build smarter forecasts.
→ Partner with business units.
→ Think beyond the numbers.

You create it through systems:

→ Automate what repeats.
→ Standardize what’s unclear.
→ Centralize what’s scattered.

As a CFO, my job is to see what others don’t, and trust me, operators often miss these critical signs.

Here are the finance red flags you need to catch early

→ Revenue Growing, But Cash Declining
 It’s easy to get excited when revenue is up. 

But if cash flow is going the opposite direction, you're heading toward trouble. 
Growth without cash is a ticking time bomb.

→ Margin “Improvements” That Aren’t Sustainable

 Margins can look better in the short term, but if the improvements aren’t built on sustainable practices, they’ll crumble. 

Watch for the quick fixes that mask deeper issues.

→ Investor Decks That Don’t Match Ops Reality

 The numbers on your investor deck can tell a great story, but if they don’t align with what’s actually happening in operations, that story won’t last long. 

A great CFO ensures the narrative matches reality.
→ Incentives Misaligned Across Teams

 If your teams aren’t working toward the same goals, you’re setting yourself up for conflict. Aligning incentives across departments keeps everyone rowing in the same direction.

The numbers can be misleading if you’re not looking at the right ones.

As a CFO, I see founders make these key mistakes all the time.

Here’s what you need to know

→ Cash ≠ Profit
 Cash flow is critical but it’s not the same as profit. 

Profitability is what ensures your business is sustainable in the long run, not just surviving month-to-month.

→ Headcount ≠ Scale
 Hiring more people doesn’t necessarily mean you're scaling. 

Real scale comes from streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and driving revenue without simply increasing headcount.

→ Raising ≠ Success
 Securing funding is important, but it doesn’t guarantee success. 

How you use that funding, and whether it drives long-term growth, is what ultimately matters.

→ Growth ≠ Health
 Fast growth is exciting, but unchecked growth without a solid foundation can lead to problems down the line. 

A healthy business grows at the right pace and with the right systems in place.

Finance teams don’t fail because they lack talent.

They fail because they scale the wrong way.

Too many companies hire fast, build rigid processes, and overload their teams before they ever become effective.

I’ve built and scaled finance teams across three continents, and here’s what actually works

1. I automated before I hired.

If a process is slow and manual, adding more people won’t fix it.

Automation gave my team time to focus on strategy instead of drowning in reports.

2. I outsourced before I built in-house.

Not every finance function needs a full-time hire.

Leveraging outsourced FP&A support kept costs down while maintaining flexibility.

3. I built thinkers, not just processors.

A finance team that only reports numbers is replaceable.

A team that challenges assumptions and drives better decisions is invaluable.

→ Offer early payment discounts; better to get 98% of your money today than 100% in 90 days.

→ Automate invoicing and follow-ups, most cash delays happen because businesses don’t chase payments.

2. Extend Payables
→ Negotiate better supplier terms.

→ Pay vendors strategically; use full payment terms instead of paying early.

→ Consolidate purchases for volume discounts and better deals.

3. Cut Non-Essential Spending
→ Cut expenses that don’t drive revenue.

→ Pause major purchases that won’t impact growth in the next six months.

→ Audit subscriptions; most businesses pay for tools they barely use.

4. Build a Rolling Cash Flow Forecast
→ Track cash weekly, not monthly.

→ Identify cash gaps before they become a crisis.

→ Plan for best and worst-case scenarios

5. Protect Essential Functions & Invest in Growth
→ Cutting costs shouldn’t mean cutting the core functions that keep the business running.

→ Identify which areas drive long-term success and protect those investments.

what matters more?

Ask any CFO, and you’ll get different answers.

Some say profitability is the goal. 

Others argue cash flow is king.

The truth? It depends on your business stage and strategy.

When Cash Flow Matters More
→ Early-stage companies: You can’t scale if you don’t have the cash to operate.

→ High-growth businesses: Investing in expansion often means running at a short-term loss.

→ Tight liquidity periods: If you can’t cover payroll or expenses, profitability on paper won’t help.

When Profitability Matters More
→ Mature businesses: At scale, consistent profitability ensures long-term sustainability.

→ Investor-backed companies nearing an exit: Buyers care about EBITDA and margins.

→ Economic downturns: When financing is harder to secure, profitable companies survive.

The CFO’s Job: Balancing Both
A profitable business can still fail if it runs out of cash.

A company with strong cash flow but no profitability will struggle long-term.

(And How to Fix It)

Many cash flow forecasts start off with blind spots that make them unreliable.
The question is by how much?

I’ve seen finance teams put together detailed forecasts, only to be blindsided when cash runs tight.
→ Revenue didn’t hit projections.
→ Customers paid later than expected.
→ Unexpected costs threw everything off.

The issue? Their forecast wasn’t built for real life.
→ It relied on perfect-world assumptions instead of real data.
→ It ignored timing mismatches between inflows and outflows.
 →It wasn’t updated often enough to reflect business shifts.

A useful cash flow forecast should
✅ Distinguish between committed cash and expected cash to avoid false confidence.
✅ Include multiple scenarios: best case, worst case, and expected case.
✅ Track actual cash movement, not just projected revenue.

If your forecast isn’t flexible, it’s just a spreadsheet, not a decision-making tool.

""Cash is king,"" but when forecasting feels like a guessing game, it’s more roulette than strategy. Indirect methods often rely on broad assumptions, but direct cash forecasting demands precision—especially when every dollar counts.

Throughout my career, I’ve used direct cash flow forecasting to guide decisions in $100B corporations, startups, and SMBs. From navigating market volatility to scaling for growth, real-time cash clarity has consistently been the difference-maker.

Here’s a quick guide to mastering direct cash flow forecasting:

1️⃣ Track Every Dollar: Achieve granular visibility into inflows (sales, collections) and outflows (payroll, rent). This isn’t just a tactical tool—it’s a window into how your business operates.

2️⃣ Focus on the Short Term: While 13-week forecasts are valuable for planning, prioritize actionable insights for the next 4-6 weeks. In challenging times, daily tracking is critical.

3️⃣ Avoid False Precision: A “correct” forecast isn’t always proof of success—it might be luck. Instead, focus on key accounts and ensure your methodology holds up.

4️⃣ Stress-Test Assumptions: Account for risks like payment delays, unexpected expenses, or market shifts to keep your forecast resilient.

5️⃣ Compare and Iterate: Review your forecast against actuals weekly. This process not only sharpens your forecasting skills but also uncovers trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.

When applied effectively, these techniques unlock actionable insights that go beyond mere survival—they empower proactive decisions. Whether it’s making timely hires, optimizing investments, or managing debt obligations, direct forecasting provides the clarity needed to drive stability and growth.

It’s more than a technical skill—it’s a strategic lever that can turn financial uncertainty into opportunity.

""Have you ever walked into a meeting with your CEO or leadership team armed with data, only to watch eyes glaze over before you even get to your key points? Turning numbers into insights is an art—and a necessity for today’s CFOs.""

During my time at both Fortune 100 companies and entrepreneurial startups, I’ve learned that numbers are powerful—but only when they tell a compelling story. Without that narrative, even the most detailed reports fall flat.

Here’s how to ensure your data drives decisions:

1️⃣ Start with the 'So What?': Begin with the insights, not the numbers. For example: ""Revenue grew 15%, but customer acquisition costs doubled. Here’s what it means for us.""

2️⃣ Tell a Story with KPIs: At Expedia, I reengineered FP&A processes to reveal real business drivers, allowing us to tie gross margin trends directly to strategic initiatives.

3️⃣ Visualize for Impact: Avoid presenting a wall of numbers. Use visualization tools to bring the story to life and ensure your points resonate.

4️⃣ Prioritize Scenario Planning: Move beyond static reports. What happens if costs rise or revenue dips? Scenario modeling equips leaders to navigate uncertainty with confidence.

5️⃣ Simplify for Clarity: A concise one-page summary can make all the difference. Reserve details for the Q&A or an appendix for deeper dives when needed.

Find Your Leadership Style: I always tell new leaders that what works for me may not work for them. Leadership isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. The best leaders are those who find their own style—one that feels authentic to them and empowers their team.

I recently attended a panel with FP&A experts, and one question stood out: “What’s the biggest change in finance over the past 30 years?”

One panelist’s answer was simple: tools. But just a few moments later, he highlighted the enduring benefits of Excel—a tool that’s been around for decades with only minor changes.

This struck me. Here we are in 2023, in a profession that should arguably be at the forefront of technology, yet we’re still heavily reliant on a tool from the 1980s. As an “old timer” myself, I can’t deny it: I use Excel constantly. There’s something about its simplicity and flexibility that feels irreplaceable. But every time I bring up Excel-based solutions, I catch my CTO giving me a look that’s equal parts pain and exasperation.

It’s a reminder that while Excel is familiar and reliable, it’s also holding us back in some ways. In an age of AI, machine learning, and real-time data analytics, we can’t afford to be stuck in the past. The future of finance demands new tools that are faster, smarter, and more collaborative.

So here’s my question for all of you: Is it time for finance to finally move beyond Excel, or will it remain our irreplaceable “Swiss Army knife” for years to come?

I've read ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini multiple times, and it's one of those books that keeps giving each time. One concept that always strikes me is how bosses tend to give more credit to their teams when they're asked to provide advice on a project. 🤔

It makes so much sense—seeking advice not only strengthens relationships but also encourages a sense of ownership and recognition. I've realized that, subconsciously, I had been using this approach with my managers in the past, and it worked well. Frequently, a few of my team members have also done this with me, which made me acknowledge their work even more.  

Cialdini explains that asking for advice creates a sense of value and involvement, leading to greater commitment and ownership. For bosses, this can boost motivation and engagement—but be careful not to overdo it, or it may seem like you're asking them to do your job.

Have you ever experienced the difference that asking for advice can make in a project or relationship? I'd love to hear your thoughts! 🗣️

There's been a talent shortage in accounting for a while now, but things are finally starting to shift. Deloitte and KPMG are backing a move away from the traditional 150-credit hour requirement for CPA licensure, opting for a more practical work experience pathway instead. This change could make it easier for people to become CPAs, which is good news for both firms and the public. 👍

However, it's important to acknowledge that many of these firms have contributed to the talent shortage by offering relatively lower starting salaries. Let's face it, accounting doesn't have the same reputation as banking or consulting, compounded by lower salaries and strict requirements, but it's also a path to become a CFO. Many of their employees are the future Controllers and CFOs, and now it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire qualified controllers with public accounting experience. Addressing compensation issues alongside changes to licensure requirements could be key to resolving the talent gap. 🤔

As CFOs, embracing AI is no longer optional—it's essential to understanding how it can transform finance and decision-making. While we don't need to become coders, we must familiarize ourselves with AI's practical applications, like machine learning and natural language processing. This isn't about deep technical expertise but about strategically collaborating with AI to explore new models, test ideas, and make decisions faster. 🚀 
 
As highlighted in the recent CFO Dive article, “What must-have AI skills do finance execs need? First, dig in,” CFOs need to relate AI directly to their company's goals. W. Michael Hsu noted that AI becomes a sandbox for strategic thinking, helping CFOs quickly analyze data and model scenarios that fit specific business needs. It's about identifying where AI can drive value, such as anomaly detection, compliance automation, or real-time forecasting. 
 
The key? Experiment with the tools. Start small with focused use cases to see how AI can optimize your operations and improve strategic outcomes.

In today’s global business environment, leading dispersed teams opens up opportunities for innovation, diversity, and cost efficiencies. From my experience managing teams across continents, I’ve seen how tapping into global talent pools can boost efficiency and creativity while keeping operational costs in check. For example, hiring in regions with lower living expenses allows companies to access top-tier talent at a fraction of the cost compared to high-expense areas like Silicon Valley. 
 
But managing global teams requires a balance of strategy and flexibility. The article Managing Global Teams: Strategies for Success highlights key challenges such as coordinating across time zones, navigating cultural differences, and ensuring compliance with local labor laws. These obstacles can slow decision-making and complicate communication. However, by establishing clear communication channels, adopting flexible work schedules, and fostering an inclusive culture, these challenges can be overcome.

In every new role I’ve taken on, there are always urgent matters demanding immediate attention — those fires that seem like they need to be put out right now. But one of the most important priorities that often gets overshadowed by urgency is building a strong team. 
 
🌟 The reality is: Building a high-performing team should never be sidelined. While urgent tasks come and go, a well-constructed team is what ensures long-term success and sustainability. 
 
A strong, capable team not only solves today’s challenges but also drives the company forward in the long run. This team becomes the backbone that helps the company tackle future problems, seize new opportunities, and add real value across all areas — especially in finance, where accurate insights and strategic decisions are crucial to growth. 
 
💡 Those extra hours you spend upfront building a strong team will pay off significantly in the long term. The time invested in finding the right people, training them, and fostering collaboration will yield the highest ROI on your time. A well-built team not only helps manage today’s fires but also becomes the driving force behind tomorrow’s success. 
 
In all my roles, whether in startups or Fortune 1000 companies, I’ve consistently focused on building teams that combine the best existing talent with new hires. This combination of fresh perspectives and institutional knowledge has allowed me to cultivate teams that don’t just execute on immediate needs but also elevate the organization’s capabilities over time. 
 
🔥 Remember: Success doesn’t come from just solving today’s problems; it’s about building the team that will take on tomorrow’s challenges and create lasting value. 
 
How do you prioritize team-building when balancing urgent tasks?

In larger companies, the structure and established processes are key. Success often depends on one’s ability to navigate complex organizational hierarchies, work within established frameworks, and drive change in a methodical way. Those who thrive here are often strategic thinkers who excel at managing long-term projects and collaborating across departments. 🤝 
 
In high-growth companies, the environment is entirely different. Speed, agility, and adaptability are crucial. Success in startups often requires a hands-on, “roll-up-your-sleeves” approach and a tolerance for risk and uncertainty. It’s less about following established processes and more about building them from scratch. 🌱🚀 
 
But here’s where the real magic happens: bringing the strengths of each environment into the other. Those who can transfer the structured, strategic thinking of corporate life into the startup world can help implement processes that allow the company to scale efficiently. 🏗️ On the flip side, injecting the creativity, innovation, and speed of startups into large corporations can break down silos, foster a culture of innovation, and drive rapid transformation. 💡 
 
The key is hiring individuals who not only understand these dynamics but can navigate and bridge both worlds. It’s not just about choosing one over the other; it’s about leveraging the best of both to drive growth, regardless of the company size. 🎯

The shortage of skilled accountants is making it harder—and more expensive—for businesses to keep their financials on track. One solution: global hiring. Beyond just back-office roles, why not extend your manager or director of accounting team offshore? 
 
However, this approach comes with challenges:

However, finding time for deep, focused work is crucial for driving impactful change and fostering innovation.

Recently, I read ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport, and it has significantly influenced my approach to productivity. Here are a few strategies I've implemented, inspired by the book's teachings:
𝟏. 𝐃𝐨 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐛 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞: Activating this on my phone, with notifications granted only for essential apps (phone, messages, etc.), has helped me create an environment conducive to deep work by minimizing distractions.
𝟐. 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: Coming from large corporations, I confess there was an overabundance of meetings, and I got used to them. Newport’s advice on minimizing shallow work inspired me to prioritize fewer, more effective meetings that add real value.
𝟑. 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐅𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬: I now allocate specific blocks of time dedicated solely to deep work, as Newport suggests, ensuring I can concentrate on high-priority tasks without interruptions.
𝟒. 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬: Inspired by the principle of focusing on the most important tasks, I ensure that my efforts are directed towards activities that yield the highest value and drive meaningful results.
𝟓. 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚: By reducing time spent on social media, I follow Newport’s guidance on eliminating shallow activities, which helps me maintain focus and productivity.

Implementing these strategies has transformed my productivity and focus, allowing me to make a greater impact. How do you manage distractions and ensure you have time for deep work? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.
