Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-17,"I learned this the hard way: If you don't control the conversation structure, the conversation controls you.

Used to be, I'd jump on calls and just see where things went. Sometimes good, usually messy.

Now I start every important call the same way:

""Here's what I'm hoping to accomplish today: 

I want to understand your current Lien process and see if there's a way we can help streamline it. 

I'll ask some questions about how things work now, share what I've seen work for similar practices, and by the end we'll both know if it makes sense to keep talking. 

Sounds good?""

Three sentences. Sets the whole tone.

Why does this work? Because in the PI world, everyone's busy. Attorneys are juggling cases. Providers are seeing patients. Nobody has time for rambling sales calls.

When you're clear about the purpose upfront, people relax. They know what to expect.

This isn't a sales trick - it's just respect for people's time.

And honestly, it helps me too. When I know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish, I ask better questions and give better answers.

I picked this up after sitting through too many calls that went nowhere because nobody knew what we were actually trying to figure out.

Structure creates clarity. Clarity builds trust. Trust leads to partnerships.

How do you structure important conversations? I'm always looking for better ways to do this.",,,,,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_i-learned-this-the-hard-way-if-you-dont-activity-7384966480582373377-JRxQ,Gain Company
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-16,"The “PE in Accounting” nightmare that never was...
On the surface, it looked like the moment the doomsayers had warned about. 
A Big 6 firm under pressure. Layoffs. 
And Apollo’s name in the debt documents.

For many, it felt like the proof point had finally arrived — 
that private equity had begun to inflict irreversible damage on accounting firms.

Except, the facts don’t hold. It wasn't PE at all.

BDO financed its ESOP with a $1.3B private-credit facility from Apollo. 
Their CEO said Apollo “took no ownership stake and was acting like a bank.” 
Ownership stayed with CPAs and employees. 
No board seats. No management control.

That doesn't make it any less painful. 
People lost jobs. Teams were disrupted. Careers were shaken. 
But this wasn’t PE pulling the strings — it was the consequence of leverage and timing.

And that difference matters. 
If we can’t tell credit from control, 
we’ll keep mistaking every capital experiment for an apocalypse.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-16,"Let me tell you about the moment I realized we had a trust problem in this industry.

I was sitting in a lawyer's office in Atlanta. Great guy, been doing PI for 20 years.

He tells me: ""Eliezer, I've got three cases stuck with my current funder. No updates in two weeks. My clients are asking questions I can't answer.""
That hit me hard.

This wasn't about funding speed or rates. It was about trust.

Here's what happens when funding communication breaks down:

The attorney can't manage client expectations. The provider doesn't know when they'll get paid. The patient starts wondering if their care team is actually coordinated.

Everyone loses confidence.

I've seen this pattern hundreds of times over 15 years. Strong case, good care, but the funding gets stuck in some black box for weeks with no explanation.
The problem isn't usually the money - it's the silence.

So here's what we changed: Every case gets regular updates. Every provider knows exactly when payment hits. Every attorney has my direct number.
Is this more work for us? Absolutely. But it's the right work.

Because when you're dealing with people's medical care and legal recovery, trust isn't optional. It's everything.

I learned this the hard way early in my career. I thought being busy meant I was being productive. Wrong. Being responsive means you're being professional.

Now when lawyers call me, they get straight answers. When providers need updates, they get real timelines. When things go sideways (they always do sometimes), everyone knows what's happening and why.

This isn't about our process being perfect - it's about our communication being honest.

What's your biggest frustration with funding communication? I bet there's a way to fix it.",1,1,,2,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_let-me-tell-you-about-the-moment-i-realized-activity-7384604057929199616-Jrdz,Gain Company
Saul Mateos,saulmateos,2025-10-16,"AI won’t replace great CFOs. It will replace the ones who don’t build systems.

Most CFOs talk about AI like it’s a concept.
For me, it’s a workflow.

A few weeks ago, I sat with Nicolas Boucher to walk through how I actually use AI in finance not theory, but daily practice.

Here’s what that looks like 👇

→ Every morning, an AI project preps me before meetings.
It pulls context from my calendar, emails, and notes so I walk into every call knowing what matters most.

→ I run multiple AIs in parallel.
While I’m building models, one is drafting insights.
While I’m in meetings, another is summarizing transcripts.
Work happens while I work.

→ Reporting is fully automated.
AI builds dashboards, flags anomalies, and generates the first draft of commentary, freeing my team to focus on decisions, not decks.

→ For pitch decks, I built a full chain.
Claude for structure.
Deep Research for validation.
GenSpark for polish.
What used to take two days now takes two hours.

But here’s what matters most.
AI isn’t about using tools. It’s about designing systems.
If you stack ten platforms without purpose, you create noise, not leverage.

So I’ve learned a few rules.
→ Orchestrate workflows, not tools.
→ Feed AI consistent context, not perfect data.
→ Build feedback loops for everything you do.

AI won’t replace CFOs.
But it will replace analysts, managers, and leaders who don’t adapt.

The ones who build systems will move faster.
The ones who don’t will get left behind.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-16,"The rules of professional services are changing.
Fast.

For decades, growth only mattered if efficiency improved.
Now, growth itself can be a lever.

Ownership isn’t equal anymore.
Capital has its own kind of leverage.
And who benefits from growth depends on how the firm is financed —
not just how it’s run.

But the fundamentals still matter.
Delegation. Pricing. Margin discipline. Repeatability.
They’re still the engine.

Because in the end, it’s still Margin × Growth.
That equation hasn’t changed — it’s just gained new multipliers.

Professional services used to be driven purely by people.
Now the equation is People × Capital × Technology.

This edition looks at the first new lever — capital —
and how asymmetric ownership is reshaping firm economics.

Next time, we’ll turn to the second: technology —
the new form of leverage redefining what “efficiency” even means.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-15,"𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: $𝟮𝗕 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗲. 𝗖𝗙𝗢 𝗼𝘂𝘁.
Citrin Cooperman just announced a CFO transition — 𝗟𝘆𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗶𝗻, 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗶𝗮𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝘂𝘁.

CFO turnover in PE-backed firms is 𝘣𝘳𝘶𝘵𝘢𝘭. 
But this one looks different.

Larry helped steer the firm from $𝟯𝟱𝟬𝗠 𝘁𝗼 𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 $𝟵𝟬𝟬𝗠 𝗶𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 in just three years —

He’s likely walking away in the position most CFOs dream of: 
financially set, reputation intact, and exiting on his own terms as the next chapter begins.

That’s the 𝟭 𝗶𝗻 𝟭𝟬𝟬 case. 
Most others end in misalignment, burnout, or a quiet “transition” when the next phase hits.

Because each stage of PE ownership demands a different CFO: 
𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 → 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 → 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 → 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-15,"A doctor called me yesterday asking why his lien payment took 6 months when the case settled 4 months ago.

Good question. Here's what actually happened:

Law firm → Broker → Funding company → Back office → Payment processor → Doctor

Five handoffs. Five opportunities for something to get stuck. Five people who aren't really talking to each other.

I've seen this story play out hundreds of times over the past 15 years.

Patient needs surgery. Case is solid. Lawyer does great work. But the money gets lost in some broker's pipeline for months because nobody wants to take responsibility for the delay.

That's not just inefficient - it's wrong.

Here's what I learned from watching too many of these situations: The more people involved in the funding process, the more places things can break down.

So we built our process differently. When we fund a case, it's a straight line:

Attorney calls me → We review the case → Money moves → Provider gets paid
No broker fees. No middleman markups. No wondering who to call when something goes sideways.

Is our process perfect? No. But it's honest. And when problems come up (they always do), there's one person to call - usually me.

I know this sounds like I'm pitching our service, but here's the real talk: I've seen too many strong cases get derailed by funding delays that had nothing to do with the case itself.

After visiting 200+ law firms, the #1 complaint I hear isn't about rates or terms. It's about communication.

""Where's my funding?"" ""When will the provider get paid?"" ""Why can't anyone give me a straight answer?""

Direct funding fixes this because there's nowhere for information to hide.

Saul Mateos,saulmateos,2025-10-14,"The CFO's real job isn't to predict, it's to prepare.

Every board deck wants certainty.

Every forecast pretends to have it.

But here's the truth most people won't say out loud:

No one can predict what's coming.
Not the markets.
Not the customers.
Not even your best model.

I learned that the hard way.

At one company, we had the ""perfect"" capital plan.
Everything lined up demand, margins, cash runway.

Then Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.
Or the IPO market shut down.
Or interest rates doubled.
Or that ""certain"" deal didn't close.

Pick your crisis. They all have the same lesson:

In 72 hours, your perfect plan becomes useless.

That's when I stopped obsessing over precision.
And started focusing on resilience.

Because the CFO's real job isn't to say what will happen 
It's to make sure the company can survive what does.

Preparation beats prediction every time.

You can't control the next downturn,
But you can control your cash discipline.

You can't forecast every customer delay,
But you can model how long you last if revenue slips.

You can't plan for every surprise,
But you can build a balance sheet that absorbs one.

The best CFOs don't sell certainty 
They build systems that bend before they break.

They ask harder questions:

What happens if growth slows 30%?

How long can we sustain this burn?

Which levers buy us time to adjust?

A great forecast gives you a roadmap.
But preparation gives you a parachute.

And when things change and they always do 
It's the parachute that saves the company, not the roadmap.

👉 Let me show some of them live this Thursday: https://vrtc.io/48jirtn

(made free thanks to Vertice sponsoring it)

Imagine you are the CFO and you see this:
SaaS prices up 11%, but 66% of seats sit idle
Renewal was last week

How would you react?

I'm sure you don't want this to happen again.

This is why we need a repeatable way to find shelfware fast


This is what we will discuss this Thursday.

Here are already some examples on how you can use AI:

1. Use GenAI to surface your true KPIs
Ask an AI model with your raw data: “Which 10 KPIs best represent software spend health—and why?” It spots board-level metrics (logins per paid seat, cost per active user, renewal risk cohorts

2. Run cohort analysis in minutes, not days
Segment by department and show 30/60/90-day activity vs. seats and cost; flag cohorts where activity falls below 5%. Finance teams report 2–8 hours; AI does the first pass in ~2 minutes

3. Automate the data mess
Prompt AI to write scripts (Google Apps Script/Office Script/VBA) to combine tabs, standardize vendor names/SSO IDs, and keep only needed columns. No more manual cleanup

4. Ask AI: “What are 100 things I don’t know but should?”
Drop in a billing summary or describe your stack. You’ll uncover blind spots—SSO mismatches, duplicate tools, zombie seats, or teams paying outside procurement

5. Invest in AI-native finance tools
Auto-categorize transactions, flag anomalies, draft entries, and connect ERP/AP/SSO/vendor exports so usage, billing, and renewals flow into one view

6. Pull data via API—with AI as your helper
Have AI draft a Python script to pull last-login and active-seat counts from Okta, Zoom, Atlassian, or M365; then join across apps. Same pattern for Salesforce renewals.

Your team can find and kill shelfware fast by pairing finance judgment with small AI workflows
Cleaner data, stronger negotiations, less waste—without waiting on engineering

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-13,"🧭 The roll-up era in accounting may be peaking.

For a while, the math worked beautifully: 
Buy firms cheap, consolidate, sell at a higher multiple.

But that window is starting to close.

PE capital is flooding in. 
Strategics are chasing the same deals. 
And valuations — especially in the mid-market — are getting frothy.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁 was about acquiring — buying firms cheap, finding synergies, and capturing multiple expansion.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 is about integrating — actually making those roll-ups 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬. 
Many are realizing that growth on paper isn’t the same as performance in practice. 
The hard part isn’t strategy — it’s execution.

That’s where real, durable value will come from next.

Most accounting firms weren’t built for that kind of execution. 
They were built for 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 and compliance — not integration and scale.

Now the market’s shifting. 
Growth depends on 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆, 𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀.
It means:
• Turning shared services into true operating leverage
• Using real-time KPIs instead of static reports
• Making finance forward-looking — not backward-reporting
• Expanding into FP&A, strategic finance, and operational advisory
  
That’s how you create value 𝘢𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 the deal, not just from it.

Most firms can’t make that shift alone. 
It’s not in their DNA — yet.

The next cycle won’t reward the biggest acquirers. 
It’ll reward the ones who 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-10-10,"I used to run the worst team meetings.

Seriously. I'd cram everything into one hour: case updates, strategy, problems, wins. Everyone would leave confused about what they were supposed to do next.

Then one of my team members pulled me aside and said, ""Eliezer, these meetings are all over the place. Can we focus on one thing at a time?""

She was right. So we split our meetings into two types:

Operations meetings: Where are cases stuck? What docs are missing? Who needs to follow up on what?

Strategy meetings: What's working across our client base? Where should we invest more time? How do we solve bigger problems?

This small change made a huge difference.

The ops meetings became crisp and actionable. The strategy meetings gave us space to actually think, not just react.

Here's what I learned: In the PI servicing world, urgency is constant. There's always a case that needs attention, a payment that's delayed, a client who needs an update.

But if you let urgency drive everything, you never get ahead of problems. You just chase them.

Now our team knows: Operations meetings for putting out fires. Strategy meetings for preventing them.

The ops stuff still gets handled - just in its own time and space. And the strategic thinking actually happens instead of getting buried under ""Hey, quick question about this case...""

It's not rocket science, but it works.

And they mean it — until the math changes.

Because independence and ownership aren’t the same thing. 
You can be “fiercely independent” and still decide, down the line, that taking outside capital helps you stay that way.

EBITDA explained to Kids
Explanations for kids... and adults!

💰 What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


❗️ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


💸 How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


👧🏼 Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


🔼 EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don’t take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

You know the type - walks into your office and immediately starts explaining features you didn't ask about. Talks past what's actually keeping you up at night.

I cringe thinking about those early meetings.

Here's what changed everything for me: I stopped trying to impress people with what we do and started asking what's actually broken.

After 15 years of visiting law firms and medical practices, I've learned that the best conversations start with one simple question:

""What made you take this meeting today?""

That's it. No agenda. No pitch deck. Just genuine curiosity about what prompted them to explore help.

The answers tell you everything:

- ""We're spending 20 hours a week chasing payments that should be automatic.""
- ""I've got strong cases sitting in limbo because I can't get straight answers from my current funding partner.""
- ""My office manager is drowning in paperwork from three different lien companies.""

Once I understand the real problem, I can figure out if we can actually help. And if we can't? I tell them honestly and point them toward someone who can.

This isn't about having perfect questions. It's about shutting up and listening.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-10-09,"Most policymakers think consumer legal funding means controlling lawsuits.
It doesn't. It's explicitly banned.

Every state that regulates consumer legal funding has the same rule: funders can't influence litigation. No control over strategy. No settlement vetoes. No fee-sharing.

Why?

Because the attorney-client relationship is the foundation of the justice system.
Consumer legal funding covers rent, food, utilities—not discovery budgets or expert witnesses.

ARC's (The Alliance for Responsible Consumer Legal Funding) latest article  breaks this down: the statutes, the ethics rules, the market realities.

When legislators lump consumer advances with commercial litigation deals, they write rules that choke off access.

Injured people facing eviction. Families pressured into early, low-value settlements. People who can't afford to wait for fairness.

If you're drafting legislation—this clarity matters.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-10-09,"Forget the $1M AI PhDs. Regular professionals who think ""AI-first"" are commanding serious premiums.

You feel it every week.

The WSJ reports AI-native engineers making $260K base vs $180K for traditional devs. That's a 44% premium for changing HOW you think, not WHAT you know.

And it's spreading beyond engineering.

I'm seeing AI-native premiums everywhere:

→ Finance teams who automate reporting
→ Marketing teams who prompt instead of brief
→ Sales ops who build AI-powered workflows
→ HR teams who use AI for analysis, not just screening

The pattern is identical: They ask “What's the real problem, and how can I solve it 10x faster?”

Example: Monthly financial close

Traditional FP&A: 5 days of Excel gymnastics
AI-native FP&A: Python + GPT-4 for variance analysis = 4 hours

Same CPA. Dramatically different value.

The brutal truth: Companies aren't paying for AI certifications. They're paying for people who ship results 5x faster because they see AI as their co-pilot, not their competition.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-09,"Heidrick & Struggles is going private.
Not the story. The story is why the multiple is lower than other splashy professional services deals—and what that says about the model.

Back-of-envelope: ~$1.3B equity value, take out a meaningful (not all) chunk of year-end cash, divide by FY’24 adj. EBITDA (~$111M) → you’re in the ~7× ballpark. So what’s driving it?

• Search is episodic, not recurring.
• Growth has been mid-single/low-double, not breakout.
• Steady-state margins ~10%-11%, not “advisory premium.”
• Adjacencies (assessment/leadership/interim) haven’t been consistently margin-accretive yet.
• Economics remain rainmaker-concentrated—key-person + macro sensitivity.
• Elite brands avoid staffing-style recurrence to protect price/brand.

Accounting trades richer on recurrence + regulation. OCFO platforms command more on velocity + semi-recurring operating cadence. Search can earn a re-rate—but it’s operational, not narrative: throughput per consultant (without discounting), productized adjacencies with real contribution, and cash-plus-equity plans (MIUs/PIs) that retain seniors.

Consumer Legal Funding (CLF) changes that. It offers a free-market solution that protects families during recovery and preserves their right to pursue justice.

Which GenAI should you actually use—ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That’s a question I get a lot

This is why I created this guide for you,
Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft’s security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it’s tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails—it works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it’s basic—too much at stake with the world’s number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you’ll never use email the old way!

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-07,"For years, PE has poured into accounting, consulting, and outsourcing. One segment always stayed off-limits: executive search.

That changed this week.

Advent International and Corvex are taking Heidrick & Struggles private — a $1.3 billion bet that even the most reputation-driven business in the industry can be platformized.

Search sits in the middle ground — it shares the volatility of OCFO advisory (event-driven, people-led) and the fragmentation of accounting (thousands of boutiques, a few giants).

Until now, that mix kept investors away.

If Advent and Corvex can prove there’s a scalable model across retained, interim, and leadership advisory, this could mark the start of PE’s next frontier in professional services.

(Prompts in text below)

By the way, I have a free masterclass on AI and Financial Analysis this Thursday:
🇬🇧 In English: https://hubs.ly/Q03LkS5p0 
🇫🇷 En Français : https://hubs.ly/Q03LkT4g0
(sponsored by Jedox)

Here's how to go from messy data to a dynamic, presentation-ready model in minutes:

1. Automate Your Month-End Close with Scripts
Still copy-pasting from multiple files into spreadsheets?

Try this instead:
Beginner:
Use Google Apps Script to clean & format data in Google Sheets
Ask ChatGPT to write the script

Advanced:
Use Python + script to merge multiple CSVs
Automatically generate a ready-to-use report
Cuts out hours of repetitive work


2. Build Financial Models with AI

All you need is:
Your P&L in CSV
ChatGPT
Prompt example:
“I am a CFO of a manufacturing company.
 I need to prepare a 5 year strategic plan with 3 scenarios:
 1- Base (sales increase by 3% per year, margin constant, cost increase by 2%)
 2- Add a gradual expansion to the US
 3- Pessimistic: -2% in sales volume year after year, margin % decrease by 1% year after year and other cost decrease only 1% year after year
Make this financial model with formulas and make sure i can change the variable with an assumption sheet""

Result:
A structured model with revenue, margin, cost variables
Assumptions tab to tweak inputs
Excel-ready, boardroom-approved


3. Turn Models into Dynamic Slide Decks

In ChatGPT’s Canvas Mode:
 Ask:
“Now build a dynamic slide deck in html to present the different scenarios based on the model you build
 I want to be able to change some assumptions in the slide deck and also have a graph to compare the 3 scenarios (revenue, margin, ebit)”

Why this matters:
You can change assumptions live during meetings
You can compare base vs. pessimistic vs. expansion models
And most importantly: you can show leadership you’re ready for any outcome

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-07,"September is supposed to be 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗸𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵 for your firm. 
Instead, it turns into 𝗸𝗶𝗱-𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵 — school schedules, practices, carpools — chaos.

By the time everyone’s back in rhythm, it’s October.

The plan was to start budgeting mid-September. 
Now no one’s sure who’s running point, and everyone’s acting like there’s still time.

I see this every year in OCFO and accounting firms — smart teams, strong businesses, but a budgeting process that quietly drifts a few weeks late.

It’s not the people — it’s the timing. 
Annual planning was never set up for success.

We start in September, when everyone’s still shaking off vacation tan lines, and run it through a stretch that feels like there are more school holidays than workdays. 

That’s why I built the 𝟭-𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝗕𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 — a rapid, outside look to reset your rhythm 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘀𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻.

You send materials in advance — budget templates, reports, your planning calendar (if one exists), and the list of stakeholders involved in budgeting.

I review, then spend one focused day with your leadership team: surfacing blind spots, stress-testing assumptions, and aligning on fixes. 
Within a few days, you get refined findings and clear next steps — fast enough to fold straight into this year’s planning cycle.

I’ve run this with firms that used to still be iterating with their boards in late January — struggling to meet lender covenants that require an approved budget. 
Now they’re getting board sign-off in mid-December — and actually focusing on their families over the holidays, not their budget.

I’m opening 𝟮–𝟯 𝘀𝗽𝗼𝘁𝘀 this month.

1. Descriptive — measure what happened
• Goal: summarize actuals for a board audience
• Prompt starter:
Q3 P&L with MoM/YoY deltas, 5-bullet exec summary, and a revenue vs. cost bar chart
• Use cases: financial statements, KPIs, headcount

2. Diagnostic — explain why it happened
• Goal: isolate drivers
• Prompt starter:
variance bridge (price, volume, mix, cost, FX, one-offs, scrap, overtime) + 3-paragraph commentary and a waterfall
• Tip: flag any driver above ±10% and apply 80/20

3. Predictive — show what could happen next
• Goal: quantify likely futures
• Prompt starter:
use last 12 months by product/pipeline, seasonality, capacity, FX; produce base/low/high with confidence bands
• Sensitivity grid: ±5% price, ±10% volume, ±3% FX; show impact on margin and EBITDA

4. Prescriptive — decide what to do
• Goal: rank actions
• Prompt starter:
list pricing, mix, discounts, SKU, overtime, freight; verify data consistency; return an impact-vs-effort decision matrix
• Board pack: top 5 actions + 120-word summary toward a 35% margin target

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-10-02,"Finance teams that understand the business beat teams that understand accounting.

You can learn accounting reading a book (or taking online courses).
Despite what they tell you in a MBA, you can't learn business judgment in a class room.

The accounting-focused finance team:
→ Knows every journal entry
→ Closes books perfectly on time
→ Builds flawless variance reports
→ Follows every compliance requirement

The business-focused finance team:
→ Knows why gross margins dropped
→ Predicts cash flow issues before they hit
→ Builds models that drive actual decisions
→ Partners with sales on deal structure

Guess which one gets invited to strategy meetings?

The difference shows up everywhere:

Accounting mindset: ""Revenue was $2.1M, up 8% from last month.""
Business mindset: ""We’re growing, but deal sizes are shrinking. Here’s why that matters for Q4.""

Accounting mindset: ""Working capital increased by $300K.""
Business mindset: ""We’re collecting slower and inventory is building. Cash will be tight in 60 days.""

Accounting mindset: ""Gross margin variance was unfavorable by 200 basis points.""
Business mindset: ""Our biggest customer is squeezing prices. We need to diversify or restructure deals.""

The career impact is brutal:

Finance people who only speak accounting stay in finance.
Finance people who speak business become business leaders.

Your technical skills get you hired.
Your business understanding gets you promoted.

The shift starts with one question:
Instead of ""What happened?"" ask ""Why does this matter?""

Every number tells a business story.
Your job isn’t just to calculate it.
It’s to translate it.

The CFOs running companies didn’t master debits and credits.
They mastered turning data into decisions.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-10-02,"At my last job, we were focused only on the P&L
But when cash became urgent, nobody knew which levers to pull
So I spent hours breaking it down:

-What drives cash in/out beyond profit
-Which KPIs actually matter
-Small fixes that create breathing room

I’ve collected these (and more) into a cheatsheet you can use: https://lnkd.in/eMZXUffh

It’s a one-stop reference with:
Essential finance formulas and KPIs
Accounting rules and principles
Working capital, cash flow, and valuation guides
Time value of money shortcuts you can apply instantly

Too many companies suffocate because they don’t manage their Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

The CCC shows how long it takes to turn investments in inventory and other assets into cash from sales

The formula is simple:
CCC = DIO + DSO – DPO

Why it matters:
- Traces the full lifecycle of cash
- Enhances cash flow by optimizing DIO, DSO, or DPO
- Highlights inefficiencies in inventory, receivables, and payables

5 ways to optimize your Cash Conversion Cycle:
1. Implement JIT Inventory – reduce excess stock, improve turnover
2. Negotiate Longer Payment Terms – extend payables without penalties
3. Streamline invoicing – expedite collections, offer early payment discounts
4. Build a strong Cash Culture – involve all departments in optimizing cash
5. Use Advanced Forecasting Tools – predict demand accurately, align inventory

Cash isn’t just a number on a balance sheet—it’s the engine that keeps your business alive and growing

How are you currently optimizing your Cash Conversion Cycle?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-10-01,"Most policymakers think consumer legal funding means controlling lawsuits.
It doesn't. It's explicitly banned.

Every state that regulates consumer legal funding has the same rule: funders can't influence litigation. No control over strategy. No settlement vetoes. No fee-sharing.

Why?

Because the attorney-client relationship is the foundation of the justice system.
Consumer legal funding covers rent, food, utilities—not discovery budgets or expert witnesses.

Eric Schuller breaks this down in his new piece for Legal Funding Journal: the statutes, the ethics rules, the market realities.

Consumer Legal Funding: Funding Lives, Not Litigation.

When legislators lump consumer advances with commercial litigation deals, they write rules that choke off access.

Injured people facing eviction. Families pressured into early, low-value settlements. People who can't afford to wait for fairness.

If you're drafting legislation—this clarity matters.

Thanks to The Alliance for Responsible Consumer Legal Funding (ARC) for continuing to educate on these distinctions.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-10-01,"Most finance leaders at advisory firms only ever live in one universe.
🌎 Front office — sourcing deals, selling scopes, sitting across from a PE CFO. 
🌍 Back office — closing the books, chasing timesheets, building dashboards no one reads.

I’ve lived in both.

I’ve sourced and sold $500k engagements to the 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗘 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗺𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱. 
I’ve built BI models that became the backbone of $200M+ growth stories. 
I’ve sat across the table from CFOs, boards, and sponsors — and closed.

And I’ve also been on the other side, deep in the trenches: 
→ Writing automations to ping late timesheet offenders 
→ Building reporting packages from scratch 
→ Forecasting headcount and utilization week by week

Here’s the kicker: the BD and execution leads I nagged internally let me do it… because they’d already seen me deliver in their universe.

That credibility — that ability to pierce the veil between front and back office — is the glue most firms don’t have.

And when you don’t?
• Engagement Letters go out with baked-in margin risk
• Delivery runs without profitability guardrails
• Finance becomes a scorekeeper instead of a growth driver

My finance function assessments are designed to fix this. 
Because I don’t just “review finance,"" and give you the tablestakes:
• Recommend shorter close timelines
• Tell you what ""best-in-class"" AR days outstanding looks like
• Give you a KPI dump (utilization, realization, revenue per FTE, etc...) 

I also rewire finance's role across the entire deal cycle.
• Pursuit teams armed with the knowledge to confidently scope engagements based on what's worked
• AR teams armed to promptly invoice: both to improve collection timing and to avoid clients receiving unexpectedly large bills
• FP&A teams armed with live data to flag margin compression and write-off risk before the Engagement Letter even goes out

For much, much less than six figures.

Can your finance function deliver on all that? If not, you're losing out on opportunities before the deal even starts.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-30,"The CFO as risk architect

Most people think the CFO’s job is to manage money.
Cash. Budgets. Forecasts. Reporting.

But the best CFOs do something bigger.
They design how the company absorbs and responds to risk.

Because risk isn’t a single event.
It’s constant.
Revenue concentration.
Market downturns.
Delayed fundraising.
Regulatory changes.
Even a single bad hire.

And here’s the truth:
Most finance teams only react when risk shows up.
By then, it’s too late.

The companies that endure are built differently.
They don’t just plan for growth.
They plan for turbulence.

That’s what risk architecture looks like.

→ Scenario planning that doesn’t just model upside, but survival.
What happens if revenue drops 20%? What if fundraising takes 6 months longer?

→ Systems that protect cash before it’s needed.
Contracts structured for flexibility. Vendor terms that buy time. Reserves that buy options.

→ Spend that’s tied to milestones, not just bank balance.
Because hiring 20 people before the model proves out isn’t strategy it’s hope.

→ Communication loops that make risk visible early.
Dashboards that surface weak signals. Narratives that show the trade-offs clearly to the board.

When it works, the company doesn’t just survive shocks.
It absorbs them.
It adapts.
It moves faster than competitors who are still scrambling for answers.

That’s what great CFOs actually do.
Not just stewards of money.
Architects of resilience.

Because in the end, capital is finite.
But risk never runs out.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-30,"You think your GTM plan for FP&A advisory is about BD. 
It’s not. 
It’s about talent. It’s about service offerings. It’s about mindset.

It’s about building a new discipline from the ground up.

Most firms try to “upskill” their existing CAS and advisory staff. 
But compliance and bookkeeping talent can’t be repurposed into Strategic FP&A.

Because accounting is about 𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘺. 
Footing and cross-footing until every number reconciles. That discipline matters. It’s the foundation FP&A builds on.

But FP&A’s job is different: it’s about 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘰 𝘶𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘺. 
• Running scenarios with multiple assumptions. 
• Building driver-based models that flex. 
• Helping leaders make decisions when the numbers won’t ever tie perfectly.

To move from “the books are clean” to “here’s how we grow.”

That’s why FP&A advisory isn’t an extension of #CAS.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-29,"A lot of people have the Sunday Scaries.
Accountants and consultants? We get the Monday Mandatories.

Early in my career, if my timesheet was late three weeks in a year, my bonus got docked. I still had that pit in my stomach two years later — even after I’d left the role.

Later, I ran the analytics on $200M of billable hours a year. My email address was the one that pinged 1,000+ people if they were even a day late submitting. (Automated, of course — but it didn’t matter. I was that guy in their inbox.)

And here’s the bigger issue: hours aren’t just painful — they’re often mismanaged.

• Leaders inflate hours to hit budget
• Managers suppress hours to cover bad scoping

Everyone in professional services has seen these games. And none of them measure what actually matters. Hours measure cost. They don’t measure value.

Now, with private equity demanding scale and AI automating the grunt work that filled timesheets, the shift away from hours isn’t optional. It’s inevitable. Firms that cling to hourly billing will be left behind.

That’s why I blew up timesheets in my own firm.

Today, when I work with clients — accounting firms, consulting firms, and PE-backed finance orgs — I don’t sell hours. I price for outcomes. Because the goal isn’t to clock time, it’s to create leverage:

• Finance functions that run without firefighting
• Scalable advisory offerings that actually sell
• PE-ready reporting and KPI frameworks that hold up in diligence

Today, it’s one of the fastest-growing corners of professional services — attracting PE capital, spawning challengers like ValueBridge Partners, and reshaping how finance creates value.

But this market wasn’t born in a boardroom.
It was born in crisis.
And it’s been defined by five eras since:

⚡From “bankers for hire” after the GFC
→ To PE becoming the natural client
→ To expansion into ops/accounting/tech
→ To PE investors backing the advisors themselves
→ To the pandemic’s two phases: crisis → hypergrowth → the music stops

And now?
The top of the market is built.
But the middle is missing.

I break down the full history — and what’s next — in this week’s newsletter.

I’ve seen it happen in startups, in provider networks, in our own servicing ecosystem.

You think you’re on the right path.
You want the thing to work.
You fall in love with the deck, not the data.

The teams that break out aren’t the smartest.
They’re the ones obsessed with reality.

The ones who say:

“Am I right? Or just attached?”
“Do customers actually care—or am I pitching to a mirror?”
“What would I kill if I had no ego in this?”

In my 15+ years working with attorneys, doctors, and founders, here’s the pattern that sticks:

Low ego. High signal-seeking. Zero tolerance for fluff.
And they surround themselves with people who challenge—not cheerlead.
They don’t get defensive.
They get curious.

It’s communication.

I didn’t believe this early in my career.
I thought the best finance leaders were the ones who built the tightest models, mastered the accounting rules, or could slice data faster than anyone else.

But the longer I’ve been in the seat, the clearer it’s become:
The numbers only matter if people understand what they mean.

A forecast is useless if operators can’t see how it connects to their world.
A board deck is noise if investors can’t see the story behind the metrics.
Even cash flow, the lifeline of every company, loses impact if leadership doesn’t understand what’s at risk.

Finance leaders don’t get paid to produce spreadsheets.
They get paid to drive decisions.
And decisions are shaped by clarity, not complexity.

I’ve seen CFOs lose the room because they buried people in variance tables.
And I’ve seen CFOs win the room with a single slide that framed risk, reward, and trade-offs in plain English.

The difference wasn’t the math.
It was the communication.

Numbers don’t move people.
Stories about numbers do.

It wasn’t born in accounting.
It wasn’t born in consulting.

It came out of the 2008 financial crisis.
Bankers suddenly out of work carried their skills into a new lane:
• Deal-grade modeling
• Transactional judgment
• Speed under pressure

➡️ A new model: PE-focused OCFO advisory.

From there, the market unfolded in distinct phases:
1️⃣ Founding & GFC Shock (2006–10): The crisis displaced #InvestmentBankers, creating the seed of a new industry (Riveron, Accordion and others).
2️⃣ Early Alignment with PE (2010–15): Firms positioned themselves as the natural partner to sponsors (CrossCountry Consulting and others).
3️⃣ New Entrants & Scaling (2016–19): A wave of boutiques formed, and the market began to professionalize (E78, Virtas Partners and others).
4️⃣ Pandemic Surge (2020–22): Demand spiked as sponsors needed faster, deeper insight into portfolio performance.
5️⃣ Operational #ValueCreation (2023–today): With PE now backing most of the leading firms, focus has shifted toward operational value creation and long-term impact.

The twist: #PE isn’t just the client anymore. It’s the owner.

This chart shows how the #OCFO market has taken shape across those five eras — and how capital has fueled its evolution.

Some adults still nod at EBITDA... without fully getting it 

Let’s fix that — with lemonade 

Explanation for kids... and adults!

💰 What is EBITDA?

EBITDA stands for:
Earnings
Before
Interest
Taxes
Depreciation
Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account certain expenses.


❗️ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


💸 How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

This gives you the company's EBITDA.


👧🏼 Example:

Let's say you and your friends sell lemonade from a stand.

You make $20 selling lemonade, but you spent $5 on lemons, sugar, and cups.

You also spent $5 on flyers to advertise your lemonade stand.

To calculate your EBITDA, you would start with the $20 you made selling lemonade, and subtract the $5 you spent on lemons, sugar, and cups.

This leaves you with $15. Then, you would subtract the $5 you spent on advertising.

This leaves you with an EBITDA of $10.


🔼 EBITDA vs Net Income

Imagine that on top of your expenses of your lemonade stand you have to pay taxes (for example to be allowed to sell on the street).

Imagine as well that you need to put money aside to invest in a new machine or a new stand because your machine is getting old.
This is called depreciation.

In EBITDA, you don’t take consideration these expenses.

But the net income is what remains as profit after all these expenses are taken in account.

—

But that’s just the start…

Modern CFOs don’t just know EBITDA — they use AI for:

- Financial Analysis 
- Automation
- Road map creation

Which I will all demonstrate in my ""How to become an AI CFO"" webinar

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-09-24,"Just finished a training session for a finance team on how to use AI for Finance

Here’s what we covered:

First I asked them how they were using AI

Most of them were only using AI for emails, research, and a little help with formulas

Not one was really leveraging AI on the core Finance tasks:
- Financial Analysis
- Reporting
- Automation

So I spent 2 hours walking them through exactly these 3 areas

Let me share with you what I taught them:

First part: Financial Analysis
I started asking them which model is best for financial analysis?

Only a few people knew this, but the best ones are: ChatGPT 5 in Thinking Mode, Copilot Analyzer Agent, and for Gemini the 2.5 Pro model.

Then I showed them the biggest mistake to avoid:
I see too many people just asking AI to “analyze your file” with no instructions
Instead, I gave them my 5-step framework:
1) Check consistency of data (my old auditor reflex).
2) Ask AI which analyses to perform: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive. (This forces it to be ambitious)
3) Run the actual calculations and show the work
4) Prepare visuals/graphs
5) Write commentary like a seasoned CFO
Try this and you will see much better results!!


Second part: Reporting
Here’s the trick almost nobody knows: the Canvas function in ChatGPT & Gemini. (Not Canva, the design tool. I mean Canvas, hidden under the tools icon in your chat box)

With Canvas, you can build dynamic slides and models
Example: a sensitivity analysis that instantly updates as you tweak assumptions

This is the part that usually gets jaws to drop.

Here’s why it’s a game-changer:
You type what you want, and it literally codes a dynamic reporting for you
It's like combining a deck of slides + a BI dashboard
All done in a few minutes

You can tweak assumptions in real-time and the slides update instantly

So instead of walking into a meeting with a static Excel full of tables…
You show up with an interactive model that answers “what if” questions on the spot
Cool right?


Third part: Automation
This part really excited them (because of the time saving opportunities!)

But most finance folks mix up AI and automation
They’re not the same:
Automation = stable, repeatable process (like an Excel formula or an Outlook rule)
AI = flexible, adaptive responses (but also always changing!)

Finance needs automation first, not AI

But the main problem: most finance people can’t code

But now AI writes the scripts for you
I demoed them how to:
- Consolidate multiple files into one automatically
- Clean and format data in seconds

All with scripts they can keep reusing. No AI needed after ;)


Finally I wrapped up with my best tip: how to create CustomGPTs / Copilot Agents using a framework I only share with clients and my AI Finance Club.


You might want to learn this for yourself as well.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-24,"Everyone talks about product-market fit. Nobody talks about communication-market fit.

But if you’ve ever built anything with a team—you feel the difference.

When I look back at the fastest-moving partnerships we’ve built at Gain—providers, firms, funders—there’s one thing they all had in common:

Response speed wasn’t “fast.” It was immediate.
Not just for ego.
Not just to look sharp.

But because the work mattered enough to not sit in limbo.

The providers who’ve scaled with us?
They move on funding requests in hours, not days.

The firms who close more cases?
They don’t ghost paperwork for 10 days and blame “backlog.”

The top teams I’ve worked with over the years—
they treat momentum like an asset.
Not hustle.
Not 24/7 Slack addiction.
But a shared rhythm.
Because when communication moves fast, trust compounds.
And when trust compounds, so does output.

So if you’re wondering why your team feels stuck, bloated, or scattered—
don’t just look at tools.

Look at timing.
Clarity doesn’t wait. Neither should replies.

The WSJ just ran a piece on Wall Street’s hiring spree — JPMorgan alone added 100+ MDs this year as M&A and IPO markets heat up. Other top banks are doing the same. Talent is the story. But so is cyclicality.

What does it mean for Office of the CFO advisory?

🔹 Talent wars are real
Bankers get poached for their relationships, deal reps, and boardroom access. OCFO firms face the same fight. The best advisors bring not just modeling and reporting skills, but trust with sponsors and operators. That’s scarce, and it’s where firms differentiate.

🔹 Cycle neutrality has limits
Compared to pure IB, OCFO is steadier. FP&A, tech enablement, and recurring finance-ops provide ballast. But let’s not pretend it’s immune — when PE deals surge, demand spikes; when activity cools, budgets tighten. We’re not zero-beta.

🔹 Positioning is everything
The winners will:
1. Invest in senior, CFO-ready talent that sponsors trust.
2. Diversify services (ops, tech, analytics) so revenue isn’t tied only to dealflow.
3. Stay close enough to PE activity to ride the wave up — but broad enough to avoid being stranded when the tide recedes.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-23,"Every #accounting firm in the $30–70M range is facing the same question:
Are we structurally ready to grow — no matter which capital path we take?

Aprio’s latest move — acquiring Mize CPAs Inc. ($47M, 300+ people) and Prism ($1.8B AUM) — shows where the bar is being set. Backed by #PE, they’re building a full-stack platform: tax, advisory, payroll, wealth, even law.

But here’s the takeaway for regional firms:
👉 The disciplines that PE sponsors insist on aren’t about making life harder. They’re the same disciplines that unlock growth while independent.

→ Centralized decision-making across partners and service lines.
→ Bullet-proof KPIs — sliceable by client, industry, partner, service.
→ Real-time insights so you can course-correct before a board (or banker) ever asks.
→ Integrated systems so your data isn’t fighting itself.

PE pushes this because they’ve made it work. Not because they want to make your finance team miserable.
But in today’s market, every firm — independent, debt-financed, or PE-backed — needs these tools to grow.

The real risk isn’t missing a deal.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-22,"One transaction. Four QoEs.
We could respond in hours — because we had already built the reporting cube long before bankers showed up.

That’s the real miss for most firms:
You don’t build “PE-ready” finance in the middle of a process.
You build it 12–18 months in advance — or risk value, timeline, and even your seat.

And the clock is ticking.
PE ownership has already hit a third of the Top 30 firms, and it’s quickly moving through the Top 100.

That’s why I built the PE-Readiness Diagnostic — a 2-week pressure test of whether your team can deliver when diligence turns up the heat:
→ Customer-level revenue cuts
→ Acquisition breakouts tied to consolidated numbers
→ Recurring vs. re-occurring vs. non-recurring revenue
→ Scenario models under pressure

If your firm is even considering PE in the next 12–24 months, now is the time.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-22,"Some of the best teams I’ve worked with didn’t share the same background.
They didn’t grow up in the same country.
They didn’t train in the same discipline.
They didn’t look at problems the same way.

And that’s exactly why they outperformed.

Over my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with teams across more than 14 countries
Finance specialists in Latin America.
Tech innovators in Europe.
Cross-functional teams in the U.S. and Asia.

Different cultures. Different lenses. Different ways of thinking.
What I saw again and again is that diverse teams don’t just work differently.
They work better.

They make stronger decisions.
Blind spots get challenged earlier.
Assumptions don’t go unchecked.
And the result is a solution that stands up under pressure.

They innovate faster.
Some of the best ideas I’ve seen came from people “outside” the expected domain.
A marketer at Coca-Cola influenced how I built a finance model.
A data scientist in SaaS reshaped how I thought about forecasting.
Cross-pollination creates breakthroughs.

And they build resilience.
In startups especially, volatility is constant.
Multicultural and cross-functional teams bring more problem-solving tools to the table.
They don’t just react differently, they anticipate differently.
That makes them harder to break when uncertainty hits.

The lesson? Numbers may be universal.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-22,"You treat a patient today.

But the money? 

It might not arrive for 6, 12, or even 18 months.

That’s not bad luck—it’s a systems issue.

And it’s one of the biggest risks in lien-backed care.

Most practices I speak with still track liens in spreadsheets, chase attorneys manually, and cross their fingers for payment.

Meanwhile:

- High-value claims go cold

- Staff burn out on follow-ups

- Collections remain unpredictable

Here’s what I’ve learned:

Revenue isn’t just lost to denials—it’s lost to disorganization.

When you don’t know which cases are close to settlement, which firms are slow to respond, or which docs are missing—every lien becomes a liability.

The solution isn’t more effort.

It’s more visibility.

When you centralise med-legal workflows and automate attorney follow-ups, lien-based care becomes what it was always meant to be: high-margin, high-impact, and finally—predictable.

How are you tracking your open liens today?

Gain,unknown,2025-09-22,"In PI law, every case isn’t just a file—it’s a revenue opportunity with timing, risk, and documentation attached.

Yet too many firms still struggle to connect case outcomes to actual collections. 
Why? 

Because:
- Open liens live in spreadsheets or email threads
- Case progress isn’t linked to revenue forecasts
- Delays and bottlenecks quietly eat into cash flow

To move from guesswork → predictability, firms need to track:
- Lien progresses through each stage
- Recovery timing versus expectations
- High-risk cases before they turn into write-offs

Predictable revenue starts by knowing which cases are likely to pay—and which need attention before cash slips away.

At Gain, we tie every case outcome to collections and recovery timelines, helping your firm act faster, prioritize effectively, and forecast revenue with confidence.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-20,"⚡ Professional Services needs a new plan

In my last post, I shared why the old way of budgeting doesn’t work anymore in professional services.
The same goes for long-range planning (LRP).

That’s why, for a limited time, I’m still offering my traditional Professional Services LRP for free (link in comments). It’s still highly relevant across many parts of the PS business model and can create real value.

But here’s the reality:
• SG&A is heavier. Tech, BD, and enablement costs are rising.
• Capex is higher. AI, automation, and platforms are now table stakes.
• Efficiency > headcount. Growth depends on getting more from the team you already have.

These shifts mean LRPs need an overhaul, not just a tune-up. And I’ll be releasing a new version soon — one that’s built for today’s market realities. That one won’t be free.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-20,"One of the most underrated hiring signals?

“Do they genuinely care?”

Not just about the title or the perks. But about the work. The mission. The outcomes. 

About doing things right, especially when it’s hard, unclear, or unglamorous.

Here’s what I’ve seen—over and over again:

1 People who care deeply will figure things out. 

2 People who care take ownership, even when no one’s watching. 

3 People who don’t? 

Eventually slow everything down—no matter how sharp their resume looks.

I’ve worked in operationally intense environments—where timing is everything, follow-through is critical, and breakdowns have real downstream consequences.

In those environments, caring isn’t a bonus trait—it’s core infrastructure.

That’s why, when I hire, I don’t just look for experience. 

I listen for evidence of care:

What’s the hardest thing you’ve ever worked on?

Why did it matter to you?

What kept you going when things got hard?

What are you most proud of?

Was it worth it?

The best people? They don’t just recall the result—they remember the effort. 

The obsession. The commitment. 

Because for them, caring is the baseline—not the exception.

That’s who you build teams with. Everything else is just window dressing.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-19,"💡 Confession: I posted about budgeting in professional services earlier.
And as soon as I hit ""Post"", I realized I’d lost the plot.

I framed budgeting the way I’ve done it successfully in the past — lock revenue, back into hiring, manage gross margin.

That worked in the old paradigm: more people → more hours → more revenue.

But the ground has shifted.
We’re not in a headcount-driven world anymore.

👉 Today’s budgeting paradigm is about efficiency, not just expansion:
→ More revenue per FTE
→ Comp increases + retention to protect your best people
→ Cross-practice leverage to balance utilization
→ L&D and higher-value services to push up realization and pricing
→ AI, automation, and platforms to free capacity and scale smarter

In other words, the budget conversation is no longer just:
“How many people do we need?”

It’s: “How do we get more from the team we have — and what investments unlock that?”

Budgeting for 2026 isn’t a spreadsheet drill.
It’s a strategic design exercise for growth, talent, and technology in a new paradigm.

+ If you are not sure, join my next masterclass: https://lnkd.in/einkvr_2

I will explain to you which AI tool you should choose for Finance

And also I will showcase my secrets on how to become an AI CFO!
1. Financial Analysis with AI
2. Scenario Modeling
3. AI Roadmap and more!


Which GenAI should you actually use
ChatGPT or Copilot?

That’s a question I get a lot

That’s why I created this guide for you.

Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
Step 3. Enter the file name
Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft’s security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it’s tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon

Bottom line
Choose based on where your work lives, not the hype
Tell me which one is your favorite ones and why!

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-17,"Accounting firms are scaling in wildly different ways right now.

→ Crete Professionals Alliance (Thrive-backed) plans to deploy $500M+ into acquisitions and AI upgrades, already surging past $300M revenue.
→ Prosperity Partners (Unity-backed) was #2 on Accounting Today’s 2025 Fastest-Growing Firms, expanding through multiple acquisitions.
→ Springline Advisory (Trinity Hunt) and Platform AG are rolling up boutiques into regional platforms.
→ Incumbents like Citrin Cooperman, Grant Thornton, and BDO are reshaping themselves with PE or private credit.

And now Aline Accounting Partners is testing something new: a $100M debt package with a $57.8M DDTL to fund add-ons. Starting from just $21M, they could add $40–60M and vault into the Top 100—without a disclosed PE sponsor.

It’s the same consolidation spectrum, but with a new twist: private credit as the driver instead of private equity.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-17,"Inside finance teams, budget season is joked as “the most wonderful time of the year.” (Spoiler: it’s not.)

When I was more junior, my wife and I took our 8-month-old to visit her grandparents in Romania. On New Year’s Eve, while the family feasted on Sarmale (Romanian stuffed cabbage — IYKYK), I was hunched over my laptop obsessing over budget scenarios.

The process hadn’t been designed properly from the start — and the cost was personal.

That’s what happens when #budgeting is treated as a spreadsheet drill instead of a strategic process:
– Infighting over departmental dollars
– Analysts building models with no strategy behind them
– Deadlines blown
– Teams grinding through the holidays when it should already be locked down

It was a real learning experience, and I never let that happen again.

If you’re an #accounting firm with a December fiscal year-end, your Annual Operating Plan (AOP) process should already be underway — or kicking off right now.

Otherwise, you risk not only missed deadlines, but also missed time with family. And that’s time you don’t get back — whether it’s stuffed cabbage or whatever special treat is on your family’s table.

After 10+ years leading these cycles for consulting and accounting firms, I’ve seen two outcomes:
✅ Strategic AOPs that align leadership and chart growth
❌ Budgets that devolve into expense allocations no one revisits

For #ManagingPartners, this isn’t about spreadsheets — it’s one of the most important levers you have to set direction.

👉 So — at your firm, is #budget season a roadmap for growth… or an expense drill?

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-16,"Most startups don’t fail because the idea was bad.
They fail because the finances were.

I’ve seen it across industries
From SaaS to EVs to consumer goods.
The pattern repeats itself every time.

The first blind spot is cash flow mismanagement.
Revenue might be climbing.
The pipeline might be full.
But if cash is trapped in receivables or inventory, the business runs out of oxygen.
Profit on paper doesn’t matter if you can’t make payroll.

The second blind spot is scaling too fast.
I’ve watched companies add headcount, launch products, and pour money into marketing before proving the model.
It feels like momentum, until the burn rate outruns reality.
Growth without a financial foundation is just acceleration toward a cliff.

The third blind spot is poor forecasting.
Too many startups rely on spreadsheets built for today.
Static, fragile, already outdated by the time the quarter ends.
Without rolling forecasts and scenario planning, leadership reacts instead of anticipates.
And by the time they see the wall, it’s too late to swerve.

Here’s the truth 
Startups don’t need perfect forecasts.
They need realistic ones.
Ones that show exactly when cash will run out.
And what levers they can pull to extend runway.

Because surviving isn’t about brilliance.
It’s about clarity.
And clarity is what separates the startups that die from the ones that endure.

That’s the trajectory Aline Accounting Partners is chasing:

→ 9 acquisitions already completed
→ Now backed by a $100M debt package, including a $57.8M delayed-draw term loan to fuel more

Houlihan Lokey, fresh off advising on some of the most significant OCFO & accounting firm transactions (Crete, CrossCountry, Williams Marston, E78, and more), advised on the deal.

It’s a structure straight out of the PE playbook: debt-fueled, acquisition-driven growth. If Aline deploys it fully, they could cross the $60M revenue threshold for Top 100 status in record time.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-15,"The Best Leadership Advice I’ve Read This Month

Last week, my colleague Danika R., VP of Operations at Gain, published an article that really stayed with me: “If I Had 15 Minutes With Every Person on My Team, Here’s What I’d Say.”

Her message was simple but profound:
→ Be quick to listen, but not quick to respond.
→ Use the tools, but don’t lose your judgment.
→ And above all, remember there’s a real person on the other side of every file.

I’ve had the privilege of working alongside Danika, and I’ve seen her lead with exactly these principles. 

In a high-stakes, high-speed business, it’s easy to focus on efficiency alone. What Danika reminds us is that efficiency without empathy is fragile.

As finance leaders, we talk a lot about data, forecasting, and strategy. But the same truth applies in finance as in operations: it’s not just what gets done it’s how we show up that defines us.

Danika’s perspective is a powerful reminder that culture, empathy, and human connection aren’t “soft skills” they’re competitive advantages.

I encourage you to read her article, Link in comment",22,4,,26,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_the-best-leadership-advice-ive-read-this-activity-7373358637421076480-sswt,Default
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-15,"KPIs are in style. Every “strategic finance” professional throws around the term. But let’s break down how strategic they actually are.

In professional services, the big KPIs are well known:
● Utilization rate
● Realization rate
● Revenue per consultant
● Gross margin by client

Useful? Absolutely. Actionable? Rarely. By the time utilization dips or realization falls, the damage is already done. These KPIs are lagging indicators.

That’s why I’ve been leaning into a different lens: aKPIs — actionable KPIs.

👉 aKPIs measure the levers you can pull today.
Examples of professional services aKPIs:
● Pipeline health aKPI: % of proposals delivered within 5 business days of client request.
● Engagement efficiency aKPI: # of proactive scope-change conversations initiated with clients.
● Talent leverage aKPI: Hours delivered by associates vs. partners on major accounts.
● Client success aKPI: % of deliverables reviewed internally 48+ hours before deadlines.

But here’s the nuance: simply calling something an aKPI isn’t enough.
For an aKPI to actually drive results, you need infrastructure:

1. Real-time tracking → If an aKPI is only updated monthly, it’s no longer actionable. Weekly or daily visibility is a must.
2. Lever maps → For each aKPI, you need a clear process map: “When this metric slips, here are the 2–3 levers to pull.” Otherwise, you’re monitoring without action.
3. Trigger systems → Alerts and dashboards that surface drift in time to act — not just in time to report.

That’s when an aKPI becomes more than a number. It becomes a control system.

I was inspired to sharpen this framing in a conversation with Soufyan Hamid, who’s been pushing the finance community to rethink how we measure and communicate performance.

🔹 Curious to hear: what’s one KPI you’ve turned into an aKPI, and how have you built the systems to make it truly actionable?",19,11,1,31,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathansaperia_kpis-are-in-style-every-strategic-finance-activity-7373337122776457216-MYDo,Default
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-14,"I’ve seen this mistake across PE-backed companies: 

Defensiveness.

Friday night asks. Reporting feedback on the “best-in-class” deck. Advisors showing up without warning.

Finance teams bristle.
It feels like criticism.
Why fix what’s working?

But the strongest teams learn to reframe it.

It’s not about what’s broken — it’s about what’s possible.

When investors push, it’s often not doubt — it’s conviction.
“You’re already performing — let’s take it further.”

And let’s not forget: they have pressure too.
LPs. Timelines. Portfolios to defend.

They’re not just your investors — they have investors of their own.

The same thing happens when external advisors show up.

It’s easy to get defensive:
“Why are they here?”
“What do they think we missed?”

But great advisors don’t show up to poke holes.
They show up to protect the upside.
To spot blind spots before they show up in the numbers.

The best finance leaders I’ve seen don’t flinch.
They collaborate.
Not because they’re uncertain —
but because they’re confident enough to welcome the help.",11,6,1,18,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathansaperia_ive-seen-this-mistake-across-pe-backed-companies-activity-7373102199759085569-E_pj,Default

Every month, you probably need to manually merge CSVs, categorize expenses, and reformat reports just to get through close.
Copy. Paste. Repeat

That was my case for some of my accounting process in my business.

So built a simple automation stack using AI — and shaved hours off my month-end process.

Here’s how you can do the same

✅ Traditional Automation – Python + Google Sheets

✅ AI Workflows – Custom GPTs for document processing

✅ AI Agents – Trigger-based actions to handle tasks automatically

----

Here are 3 practical ways finance teams can use AI to save time, reduce errors, and focus on higher-value work:

1️⃣ Automating the Close with AI

- Use Python scripts or Google Apps Script to clean, merge, and format data
- Automate file cleanup in Google Sheets or Excel
- No more manually removing empty rows or formatting columns


2️⃣ AI for Expense Categorization

One of the biggest time-wasters? Manually categorizing expenses.
You can automate this using a Custom GPT:

Steps include:
- Create your GPT
- Upload a CSV
- Let GPT classify expenses by category
- Download a clean, categorized report for upload

One finance pro from the AI Finance Club eliminated 90% of manual expense categorization using this!

3️⃣ Categorization Agent

📥 With tools like n8n, you can:

- Detect incoming CSV files
- Clean data with formatting rules
- Use AI to categorize each transaction
- Output everything neatly into a single file

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-12,"Excel is the cockroach of enterprise software that survived all nuclear winter.
Neither Python, Tableau, Power BI, nor even AI could kill it.

We’ve all tried the “AI replaces spreadsheets” experiment.
You prompt ChatGPT to adjust a model. It rebuilds everything.
Nothing ties. You fight it for two hours...
Then reopen Excel and fix it in 20 minutes.

That’s not failure. That’s judgment.

My team now uses AI to write formulas, prep data, even draft dashboards.

But we still deliver in Excel because when your CFO asks
“Where did this number come from?”
you need to click through the logic, not re-run a prompt.

This is how we actually work in 2025.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-12,"Want to be a CFO? Do it for the right reasons.

I used to think becoming a CFO meant I’d finally made it.

The title. The boardroom. The strategy. The upside.

But here’s the part that doesn’t show up in the headlines:
→ It’s lonely.
→ You’re constantly on the hook.
→ If anything breaks, your name’s the first on the list.
→ And yes—at every level up the finance ladder, I’ve worked more, not less.

In private equity-backed companies, CFO turnover is sky-high.
Why?
A mix of burnout + zero tolerance for underperformance.
The expectations are brutal—and not always realistic.

To the up-and-comers in finance:

I know it’s tempting to chase the title.
But make sure you know what you’re really signing up for.
It’s not prestige. It’s pressure.
It’s not just numbers. It’s narrative, politics, and accountability.

👉 To the CFOs out there:
I respect you more than you can imagine.
You carry a weight most people never see.
You hold the line when no one else can.

If you want to become a CFO, do it.
But do it for the right reasons:
→ Because you love owning the outcome
→ Because you can lead through chaos
→ Because you’re willing to be the one who stays calm when everyone else panics

Just don’t do it for the LinkedIn headline.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-09-12,"In PI, we're not just processing cases—we're supporting attorneys, providers, and injured people through some of their most challenging moments. That requires more than efficiency; it requires leaders who understand that speed without discernment creates costly mistakes.

""Be quick to listen, but not quick to respond. Use the tools, but don't lose your judgment. And above all, remember—there's a real person on the other side of every file.""

Multiples are hot. Deal flow is steady. Everyone wants a platform.

But this wave is cresting.
Valuations are stretched. Differentiation is thinning.
And smart sponsors are starting to ask: what comes next?

💡 The answer isn’t more audit revenue.
It’s something else entirely.

A growing group of funds are quietly building dual-platform strategies — combining compliance and strategic finance under one roof.

But the real question isn’t who owns both sides.
It’s who integrates first.

Parthenon Capital started with Cherry Bekaert (Accounting), then added Embark (OCFO).
Further Global Capital Management led with E78 (OCFO), before acquiring Armanino (Accounting).

The structure is there. The timing is right.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-08,"Private equity isn’t just buying Accounting Firms.
They’ve been investing in OCFO Advisory firms for over a decade —
but only recently have they started buying both sides of the finance stack.

EDIT: full article now available! https://lnkd.in/gF6TxAUN

One of the earliest to spot this opportunity? New Mountain Capital.
They acquired Citrin Cooperman, scaled it, and in a landmark move…
sold it to Blackstone — the first-ever PE-to-PE “turn” in accounting history.

That ""turn"" marked a turning point.

Within months, New Mountain went on a spree:
→ Wipfli
→ Grant Thornton
→ Portage Point Partners — a pure-play advisory firm with a strong OCFO practice
All brought into the NMC portfolio.

And they’re not alone. Today, several funds are building dual-platform strategies:
➡️ Charlesbank: Accordion (OCFO) + Aprio (Accounting)
➡️ Parthenon Capital: Embark (OCFO) + Cherry Bekaert (Accounting)
➡️ Unity Partners: Amplēo (OCFO) + Prosperity Partners (Accounting)

Some started with advisory and added accounting. Others did the reverse.
But either way, this isn’t just roll-up economics.
It’s convergence.

Here’s the nuance most don’t see yet:
→ These firms are still being run independently.
→ Same fund, different playbooks.
→ Maybe a little knowledge-sharing… but no real collaboration.

So the question becomes:
🔄 Will we start to see cross-portfolio collaboration?
🤝 Will any of these pairs eventually merge into a unified platform?
📈 Will a full-stack “Finance Platform” emerge — spanning audit, tax, CFO services, and FP&A?

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-08,"If your finance team spends more time formatting decks than influencing strategy, you hired wrong

I’ve seen this play out too many times.

The finance team works late nights building perfect slides.
Charts are aligned. Fonts are consistent. Every number ties back.

And yet, when the deck hits the table… nothing changes.
Because pretty slides don’t drive strategy.

Here’s the truth:

A finance team that’s focused on presentation instead of perspective is a wasted investment.

Great decks might impress for a moment. Great insights shape decisions for months.

The difference comes down to what you hire for:

→ Do they ask why the numbers look the way they do?
Or do they just copy-paste into slides without questioning the assumptions?

→ Do they connect the data to real business trade-offs?
Or do they just report history without showing what it means for tomorrow?

→ Do they simplify complexity for leadership?
Or do they hide behind jargon and endless tables that no one will use?

Formatting can be outsourced.
Insight cannot.

If your finance team isn’t influencing where to spend, when to hire, or how to manage cash, then you don’t have finance you have reporting.

The best finance teams don’t just track the business.
They change how it runs.

🔹 Does my AI strategy deliver value?
🔹 Which AI initiatives should I prioritize?
🔹 How do I align AI with my business goals?

🔹 How should YOUR finance team integrate AI?

📌 Small Companies (0-1,000 Employees)

- Use Generative AI tools like Gemini for automation & insights
- Digitize invoice processing using AI-powered OCR & NLP tools

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-07,"“EBITDA is lazy.”
No—calling EBITDA lazy is lazy.

It’s become the go-to dunk for people trying to sound smart.
“Cash is king.” “EBITDA isn’t real.” “CapEx and working capital!”
👏👏👏

But here’s the thing:
If you’re headed toward a transaction, your business will be valued on EBITDA.
Not your cash balance.
Not your GAAP net income.
EBITDA. Full stop.

Why?

Because buyers aren’t buying your past.
They’re buying what they can do with your business.

Yes—cash is important.
But saying “cash is king” is like saying “oxygen is important.”
We get it. You still need a map.
And EBITDA is the map.

It lets buyers run scenarios, flex capital structures, and compare apples to apples.
That’s why your current Interest Expense?
Irrelevant.

Now here’s where it gets even lazier:
Everyone sweats EBITDA down to the decimal…
…but treats the multiple like it’s handed down by the market gods.

It’s not.

The multiple is earned.

Earned through things like:
🧩 Revenue quality
⚙️ Delivery risk
💵 Pricing power
📊 Team sophistication
🏗️ Systems maturity
📈 Growth clarity

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-05,"Regulation Needs Precision — Not Panic.

The growing crackdown on third-party litigation funding is understandable. 

But not all funding is created equal.

At Gain, we sit at the intersection of patient care and case outcomes—supporting providers who treat on lien so injured people can get care before a settlement comes through.

The challenge?

Regulators are conflating med-legal servicing with speculative litigation funding models. 

 Its dangerous, as it risks cutting off access to care and bankrupting providers for following the rules.

We’re not betting on legal outcomes. 

We’re supporting care that’s already been delivered—and tying revenue to case progress in a transparent, accountable way.

If lawmakers want to regulate this space, they should. 

But they need to regulate the right thing.

We’re open to oversight. 

We’re not okay with being mislabeled.

Let’s get the definitions right—before we break something that was never the problem.

Most CFOs I meet fall into two camps:

Traditional CFOs rely on judgment and experience
AI CFOs add speed, insight, and scale

Which one are you today?

Traditional CFOs are diligent. Every month, he:
1. Spends 2 days making board decks
2. Writes 6 hours of financial commentary
3. Consolidates Excel files for 3–4 hours
4. Feels stressed in audits due to poor docs

AI CFOs does this to save time each month:
1. Automates files with ChatGPT + Python
2. Creates tailored commentaries in 10 minutes
3. Builds models with simple prompts
4. Drafts SOPs, letters, and checklists instantly

Both are smart. Both are experienced
But one spends his time buried in spreadsheets
The other spends his time leading

That’s the shift from Traditional CFO ➝ AI-Driven CFO

Why it matters:

Traditional CFOs rely on credibility, judgment, and personal leadership. But they also suffer from:
1. Manual, slower processes
2. Limited visibility for real-time forecasting
3. Higher error risks with complex data
4. Struggles to scale insights across fast-changing markets

AI-Driven CFOs keep the leadership strengths and add speed, automation, and insight. They:
1. Run “what-if” scenarios in real time
2. Detect anomalies 24/7
3. Free up time from routine tasks to lead & coach
4. Scale faster without losing oversight

How to be an AI CFO:
Begin by applying AI to the finance tasks that drain the most time

1. Generate financial commentary → 6-hour process cut to 10 minutes
2. Run scenario modeling → instant best/worst-case outcomes
3. Merge financial files → save hours in reporting cycles

The reality is clear: AI is no longer optional for CFOs who want to lead at scale

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-04,"I’m not 20% faster with AI.
I’m 10x more dangerous.

Last week I built a dashboard with Claude Code.

My CTO calls it shadow IT.
My board calls it having answers before they ask questions.

This isn’t about efficiency.
It’s about capability.

Building assumptions
Shortcut AI doesn’t save me an hour on assumptions.
It lets me test 20 scenarios instead of 3.
Every assumption. Every angle. Every edge case the board might throw at me.

Dynamic reporting
I didn’t just automate my old dashboard.
I built one with Claude Code that answers questions I couldn’t even ask before.
45 minutes. No IT ticket. No vendor.
Just me and an AI building exactly what I need.

Market analysis
Deep Research and Claude don’t save me from reading 10-Qs.
They let me analyze every competitor, every earnings call, every market trend.
The analysis I could never justify the time for?
Now it’s standard.

I’m not doing my old job faster.
I’m doing a job that didn’t exist.

One CFO with AI can now outgun a team of analysts.
Not by working harder.
By working at a different scale.

The CFOs still talking about “time savings”?
They’re missing the plot.

This isn’t about doing less Excel.
It’s about being everywhere at once.
Having every answer.
Seeing every angle.
Testing every scenario.

Most CFOs will wait for IT approval.
The dangerous ones are already building.

Your move.

It answers questions before my CEO thinks to ask them.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-09-04,"Rainmakers get the credit.
But internal referrals build the firm.

Most people think of business development at professional-services firms as:
🍾 Champagne with PE deal partners
⛳ Golf with managing directors

It feels glorious to some, daunting to others.
Like you need a massive Rolodex…
…and maybe a diamond-encrusted Rolex too. 💎

But some of the best firms don’t rely on rainmakers.
They rely on something quieter—
👉 Internal cross-sell.

I’ve always believed internal referrals are one of the most powerful levers a firm can build.
And recent conversations have reinforced just how intentionally the best firms are operationalizing it.

But it’s not a flip-a-switch tactic.
It’s a multi-layered process:
1️⃣ Recognize how valuable internal cross-sell actually is
2️⃣ Build the muscles—train teams to spot and share real opportunities
 → This only works if there’s a culture of collaboration, not hoarding
 → Clients don’t “belong” to individual partners—they belong to the firm
3️⃣ Build the systems—track, reward, and scale what works

That last one? Brutal.
Traditional BD is hard enough to measure.
Internal BD adds a whole new layer—
You’re tracking trust. Conversations. Follow-through.

But the firms that crack it?
They build a quiet engine.
One that compounds over time.

It creates a flywheel:
→ Deliver exceptional work in one area
→ Build trust across the account
→ Let referrals pull in new services—without ever “selling”

If you think BD is only for extroverts and rainmakers…
You’re missing where the real leverage lives.
Internal cross-sell is the unsexy system behind sustainable growth.
And it separates firms that hustle…
from firms that scale.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-09-03,"EBITDA Explained

10 Free finance resources: https://lnkd.in/gDvEERe5

What is EBITDA, and what is your take on this metric?

→ EBITDA stands for:
• Earnings
• Before
• Interest
• Taxes
• Depreciation
• Amortization

It's a financial metric that shows how much money a company makes before taking into account non-operational expenses like interest and taxes and non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization

→ Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

EBITDA is important because it gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.


→ How is EBITDA calculated?

To calculate EBITDA, you need to start with a company's revenue and subtract its cost of goods sold.

Then, you subtract its operating expenses (like salaries and rent).

Another way to calculate it:

Net Income
+ Interest Expense
+ Taxes
+ Depreciation
+ Amortization

→ EBITDA vs. Net Income

EBITDA:
In EBITDA, you don’t take into consideration these expenses: Depreciation, Taxes, Interest.

Net Income:
But the net income is what remains as actual profit after depreciation, interest, taxes are taken in account.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-09-02,"4 budgeting frameworks to try if you hate budgeting

Most leaders hate budgeting. 
And honestly, I don’t blame them.

Traditional budgets are slow.
They’re outdated the moment they’re done.
And they often feel more like a political process than a planning tool.

But here’s the truth 
The problem isn’t budgeting itself.
It’s the framework you’re using.

Here are 4 approaches that actually work, depending on where your business is 

1. Zero-based budgeting
Start from zero every year.
Force every expense to be justified, not just carried forward.
Great for lean teams or companies that need to cut fat without killing growth.

2. Top-down + bottom-up blend
Leadership sets targets. Teams build from the ground up.
The budget becomes a negotiation between ambition and reality.
Perfect for high-growth companies that want alignment across departments.

3. Rolling reforecast (R12)
Forget the annual budget. Update every month or quarter on a rolling 12-month basis.
This keeps the focus on agility, not predicting the unpredictable.
Best for dynamic industries where conditions change fast.

Strategic initiative-based budgeting
Instead of line items, budget around priorities: new product, market expansion, sales motion.
It forces alignment of dollars to strategy, not just costs to departments.

Budgeting doesn’t have to be painful.
But it does have to be intentional.

The right framework gives you clarity, flexibility, and control.
The wrong one gives you noise.

Which framework does your team use and does it actually work?",34,20,,54,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_4-budgeting-frameworks-to-try-if-you-hate-activity-7368646230484107267-Rrmk,Default

That’s why James Ransome's recent post stuck with me — especially this line:
“𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗲, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗮 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻.”

That ability is rare. I’ve done it. And while I’m not claiming to be the only one, the list is short. Very short.

𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝗺𝘀 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗻𝘀?
✅ Make sure you know the order of your priorities
✅ Get serious about your true #1 priority — BD, buildout, or delivery
✅ Hire for 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 — and stop pretending it’s all three
✅ Supplement the rest with 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 — senior advisors who’ve actually built this before

You don’t need to give up equity.
You don’t need to wait 6-12 months.
You just need someone who knows the blueprint — and can accelerate you from the inside and alongside.

If you’re building — let’s talk.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-09-02,"Being right isn’t enough. You have to be heard. And being heard isn’t enough. 

You have to influence action.

That’s the real challenge in any complex system—whether it’s a healthcare network, a law firm, or a tech company.

We’ve all been there:

-A solid solution

-A smarter process

-A fix everyone should want...

And still, no buy-in. No momentum. No change.

What I’ve learned over the years is that influence isn’t about control—it’s about clarity, connection, and timing.

It starts with: 

→ Understanding what success looks like for you 

→ Then mapping what it looks like for them 

→ And finally, aligning those visions so people want to move forward with you—not because they’re told to, but because they’re convinced it’s the right path.

At Gain, we don’t just build systems for better revenue outcomes. 

We help leaders build influence internally—so better ideas actually get implemented.

Because operational excellence isn’t just about dashboards. It’s about people moving in sync, toward something they all believe in.

Where are you seeing influence gaps in your org right now? Curious to hear how others navigate this.

You likely missed it.... here is your full guide:

Already ranked #1 on the LLM Arena leaderboard,
scoring 200 points ahead of other tools

LLMArena is where users interact with two anonymous LLMs then vote for the one they prefer

Why does it matter?
Because it fixes 3 major pain points
AI image models have struggled with for years:

1. Consistency – no more “AI face” problems or mismatched styles

2. Multi-step natural edits – edit background, replace text, adjust visuals, all in one flow

3. Blending & fusion – images look natural, not stitched together, and take note, this is only the preview model!

This is a leap forward for:

1. Finance visuals (reports, dashboards, IPO decks)

2. Executive headshots & media content

3. Brand consistency (style-coherent graphics)

4. M&A deal storyboards

In this infographic I break it down:

1. What Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is & where to access

2. Why it’s such a breakthrough for enterprise visuals

3. Model comparison vs. ChatGPT 4o

4. Strengths, weaknesses, and when to use it

5. Real finance use cases

6. Most importantly, a remedy fix for low-quality

Finance leaders, think investor decks that actually look professional storyboards for deals, and clear visualizations for KPIs

Oh, and the key thing I want you to remember:

The same prompt that produces good results in one tool may not work as well in another tool

Nano Banana - Gemini 2.5 Flash Image preview

Strengths

1. Great at “don’t change X, only change Y”

2. Precise edits and continuity

3. It obeys instructions literally, so prompts need to be direct

Weaknesses

1. Struggles with highly creative prompts (“make this anime-style” often falls flat)

2. Needs careful data input—typos or sloppy metrics can propagate

3. Output is low-res, but this seems limited to the Preview model

ChatGPT 4o Image gen

Strengths

1. Strong when asked to invent visuals from scratch

2. Iterative chat flow is its superpower—describe, refine, reframe

3. Responds best to descriptive, stylized storytelling prompts

Weaknesses

1. Terrible at “don’t change X, only change Y” scenarios

2. Struggles with reference-image editing

3. Data-heavy prompts sometimes lose fidelity (numbers can change)

Use precise instructions to get the most out of Nano Banana

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-28,"A financial model is only as good as the conversations it creates

Most finance teams think the value of a model lives in the numbers.
How precise it is.
How many tabs it has.
How airtight the formulas are.

But the truth is 
A model is useless if it doesn’t change how leaders think and act.

I’ve seen models built to perfection—60 tabs, immaculate logic, variance reconciled to the decimal.
And yet, no decisions changed.
No trade-offs clarified.
No strategy sharpened.

Because numbers don’t move a business.
Conversations do.

Here’s what the best models actually do:

→ They spark hard hiring conversations.
“Do we add 10 people this quarter, or do we delay until revenue catches up?”

→ They challenge strategy.
“If we expand into this market, do margins hold or collapse under scale?”

→ They expose trade-offs.
“Do we double down on product now, or extend runway to survive another 18 months?”

→ They force discipline.
“What happens if funding takes 6 months longer than expected?”

A financial model isn’t supposed to predict the future.
It’s supposed to create clarity in the present.
Clarity that drives alignment in the boardroom.
Clarity that forces executives to face uncomfortable truths.
Clarity that moves decisions forward instead of recycling the same debates every quarter.

If your financial model isn’t sparking debate, testing assumptions, and changing how leaders allocate capital…
Then you don’t have a financial model.
You have a spreadsheet.

The best CFOs don’t build models to show what might happen.
They build them to make sure the right conversations happen.

Because numbers don’t win.
Decisions do.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-28,"Advisory has more than one front door.

For some, it’s diligence.
For others, it’s valuation.

🧩 Crete Professionals Alliance  + Cabrillo shows how that plays out.

Cabrillo brings:
• Business, security & IP valuations
• Fairness opinions for M&A and financing
• Equity comp, estate & gift planning
• Complex GAAP, tax, and reporting support

This isn’t compliance.
It’s high-trust, high-context advisory.

⸻

Why it matters:

➡️ For Crete’s member firms:
Valuation becomes part of their client offering — overnight.

➡️ For Cabrillo:
National reach.
Cross-sell opportunities.
Shared services: HR, IT, legal, AI tooling.
Offshore delivery teams.
Growth infrastructure.
No brand dilution.

⸻

Crete didn’t buy Cabrillo — they took an equity stake.
A partnership, not a takeover.
Strategic alignment, not assimilation.

⸻

This isn’t a roll-up.
It’s a platform.
Built from scratch.

Modern tech.
Centralized ops.
$500M to deploy.
20+ firms already on board.
California as a key growth frontier.

⸻

Valuation here is advisory.
And also a wedge.

Because when you help a client navigate valuation…
You’re often still in the room for what comes next:

→ Comp
→ Tax
→ Audit
→ Strategy

That’s not just expansion.
That’s positioning.

⸻

Advisory is the entry point.
Infrastructure is the multiplier.
Crete is designing both.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-08-27,"CFOs keep asking me: “How do we skill the team on AI without chaos or risks?”

My answer:

- Pick one secure tool fitting your current environment
- Teach real use cases you can repeat
- Create an environment and platform where people learn from each other

Why this works:

- We avoid “shadow IT” by selecting one approved AI inside their existing security perimeter (mostly Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace).

- Then we run a 30-day enablement: adapted use cases, hands-on prompts, custom finance agents, and I help them build an environment for sharing wins.

This structure consistently drives adoption.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-27,"PI servicing operates in a gray space—and that’s part of the problem.

Most med-legal service providers didn’t start in finance.

That shows up in how contracts are written, licenses are tracked, and laws are interpreted.

In many cases, regulatory strategy = “Wait until someone complains, then fix it.”

I’ve worked in environments where you build for compliance on Day 1.

Where regulators audit your inbox, not just your quarterly reports.

Where transparency isn’t just an ideal—it’s infrastructure.

This space needs that mindset.

Because as the stakes rise—politically and financially—the difference between “almost compliant” and “fully defensible” won’t just be legal.

It’ll be existential.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-25,"The 5 hardest truths no one tells you before becoming a CFO

Everyone talks about the prestige of the CFO seat.
The board meetings. The influence. The strategy.

But no one prepares you for the realities that come with it.

Here are 5 truths I wish someone had told me earlier 

1. The numbers are the easy part
Models, reports, forecasts, those are table stakes.
What really tests you is driving alignment when the numbers say something no one wants to hear.

2. You won’t always be liked
Good CFOs make tough calls.
Great CFOs make them earlier than anyone else wants to.
Clarity doesn’t always make you popular but it keeps the company alive.

3. Your job resets every 6 months
At $5M ARR, you’re cleaning up the books.
At $20M, you’re building systems.
At $50M, you’re shaping strategy.
If you don’t evolve with the role, you’ll get left behind.

4. You spend more time on people than numbers
Coaching controllers. Translating finance for operators.
Building trust with the CEO and board.
The spreadsheet is the tool but people are the job.

5. Speed beats polish
You’ll never have perfect data.
You’ll never have the full picture.
You have to make the call anyway and own it.

No one tells you these truths when you’re climbing.
But they’re the difference between CFOs who survive and CFOs who scale.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-25,"Accounting firms are looking in the wrong place to build their OCFO Strategic Finance advisory practices.

Most accounting firms think their OCFO advisory bench is the closest thing to Strategic Finance.

It’s not.

👉 The real on-ramp is Financial Due Diligence (FDD).

Why?
• EBITDA normalization = Strat Fin’s cash flow bridge
• Deal cadence = the same transaction rhythm as portcos
• Sponsor exposure = daily conversations with PE and lenders

At my prior firm, we mostly staffed Strat Fin from IB and FP&A.
But when we brought in FDD talent?
Many were just as strong in Excel modeling — sometimes stronger.

True Strat Fin firms know this.
They staff from adjacencies like IB, FP&A, T&R.

Accounting firms often miss it.

4 Complex Finance & Accounting Topics, explained to kids... and adults!

Forward it to a non-finance colleague who needs to see this!

1. EBITDA

What is EBITDA?

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization

Why is EBITDA important for Businesses?

• EBITDA gives businesses an idea of how much money they're generating from their operations.

• This is useful for investors and lenders who want to know how profitable a company is.

• It’s like a scorecard to know how much money a company is making.

2. CAPEX

What is CAPEX?

Capex, short for “C﻿apital Expenditure”

It is a long-term investment made by a business in assets like equipment, property, and buildings.

These investments provide benefits to the company for years to come, and can help businesses grow and improve their operations.

Why is CAPEX essential for businesses?

• It helps businesses grow and improve their operations.

• It can help increase productivity and efficiency.

• It can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

3. Cash

What is Cash Flow?

It is like the money that comes in and out of your piggy bank.

Why is Cash Flow important for businesses?

It is important for Businesses & Adults because they need to make sure they have enough money to:

• Pay for things like rent, salaries, and supplies.

• Invest in growing business or saving for the future.

4. Tax

What is Tax?

Think of tax like a membership fee you pay to be part of a club, but this club is your country or city.

This money is used to keep parks clean, schools running, and streets safe.

Why is it important?

In real life, taxes pay for things like libraries, firefighters, and playgrounds.

When you enjoy a clean beach or a safe road, it's partly thanks to taxes.

Gain,unknown,2025-08-22,"In PI law, a lien isn’t just a balance—it’s a living financial asset tied to legal risk, time, and documentation.
But too many firms still rely on traditional AR reports that miss the mark. Why? Because:
Aging buckets ≠ Real-time risk
You need to track:
Conversion probability
Recovery velocity
Documentation completeness
Smart firms are moving from reconciliation → optimization.
This shift requires:
1 Real-time lien visibility
2  Risk scoring by attorney, case, and jurisdiction
3 Coordination across legal, finance & collections
Forecasting liquidity starts by knowing which liens are maturing—and which are quietly going stale.
At Gain, we treat liens like what they are: financial assets with legal dependencies. Our platform helps you score, track, and recover smarter—so every dollar tied up in a lien moves closer to cash.
Let’s turn PI receivables into a revenue strategy, not just a report.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-22,"Another shot fired in accounting’s shift from audit to advisory.

Accounting firms don’t really want to sell audits anymore.
They want to sell advisory — because that’s where the rate card (and the margins) live.

Grant Thornton (US)’s acquisition of Stax is a case study in how the best firms are playing out this game of chess.

Stax plugs into the PE lifecycle at exactly the right moments:

• Commercial due diligence & exit readiness
→ natural bridge to financial due diligence

• Diligence mandates
→ often the trigger for 100-day planning and value creation

• Once the firm knows the ins and outs
→ far less friction to layer in recurring attest and more

If you’ve sold CDD into a sponsor, you’ve seen it:
One mandate turns into five.
Advisory turns into infrastructure.
Suddenly, the “accounting firm” is everywhere.

This isn’t just about margin lift.

It’s about owning the relationship — from diligence to exit —
and monetizing every stage along the way.

Advisory is the new front door.
Attest is the sticky back end.
And firms like GT are quietly building the whole house.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-21,"Most companies don’t fail because of bad products.
They fail because of bad finance decisions.

Here are 7 finance mistakes that cost companies millions

1. Hiring too early.
You don’t need a full-time CFO when a part-time controller would do.

2. Scaling before systems.
Headcount without clean workflows = chaos at scale.

3. Confusing revenue with cash flow.
Revenue looks good in a pitch deck. Cash pays payroll.

4. Forecasting on hope, not data.
Optimism makes pretty models. Reality breaks them fast.

5. Ignoring unit economics.
Top-line growth hides weak margins. Bad economics always win in the end.

6. Treating FP&A like reporting.
Closing the books isn’t enough. FP&A exists to drive better decisions.

7. Waiting too long to cut costs.
Hope is not a strategy. Delay turns small cuts into existential crises.

The smartest companies don’t avoid every mistake.
They spot them early before they turn fatal.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-21,"I used to think speed in PI funding came down to paperwork.
Get the docs. Get the signatures. Get the approval.
But I was wrong.
Because what really slows things down isn’t process.
It’s opacity.
Too many stakeholders.
Too many emails with no clear owner.
Cases stalled. Providers left waiting.
Patients stuck in limbo while funding sat in someone’s inbox.
That’s when I realised:
PI funding didn’t need more tech.
It needed more truth.
So we stripped it all down and rebuilt it—at Gain.
→ No middlemen. Just a direct line from provider and attorney to funder.
→ No markup games. Just transparent economics everyone understands.
→ No black boxes. Just real-time visibility into where a case stands.
This isn’t just about speeding up approvals (though we often do it in 48 hours).
It’s about operational clarity in a space that’s built on chaos.
Because when funding flows, care gets delivered.
When attorneys aren’t chasing signatures, cases move.
When providers trust the system, they show up ready.
That’s the difference a clean infrastructure makes.
That’s what we’re building at Gain.
If your funding feels like a bottleneck instead of a bridge—

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-08-20,"ChatGPT vs Copilot vs Gemini

+ Free Top 100 ChatGPT tips: https://lnkd.in/gdmuBSVX

Which GenAI should you actually use—ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini?
That’s a question I get a lot.

That’s why I created this guide for you.

Here’s my clear rules on which one to choose:

1 - INDIVIDUALS & SMALL BUSINESSES

You’re an individual or small business not fully in Microsoft or Google?

Recommendation: ChatGPT (take the Teams license if you’re a small business—it has enterprise-grade security and is SOC2 Type II compliant).

It has the best functionalities, best interface and always ships innovative models first.

Drawback: it's not yet fully connected with your business data (though it's improving with connectors to Google Drive, Calendar, OneDrive, Outlook).

This is the one I use for me and my team.


2 - BUSINESSES USING MICROSOFT

You guessed it: Copilot.

Why?
Because Copilot 365 with Microsoft 365 brings AI directly to your work data.

This is Copilot’s most underrated feature—and the main reason to choose it if you’re a Microsoft shop.

Try this:
 Step 1. Switch to ""Work"" mode
 Step 2. Type ""/"" in Copilot and access a doc
 Step 3. Enter the file name
 Step 4. Ask Copilot to perform a task on it
 Step 5. AI works with real context from your files

That’s a huge advantage over ChatGPT or tools not connected to your work data, where you need preliminary steps to provide context.

If you already trust Microsoft with Outlook and Excel online, Copilot makes perfect sense:
- No extra vendor to manage
- Your confidential info stays in Microsoft’s security graph (the same Copilot uses)
- No separate user/license management (it’s tied to Microsoft 365)

And Copilot is just getting started.
I got insights from Microsoft teams telling me that they are working to integrate AI deeper with more promising features coming soon.


3 - INDIVIDUALS & BUSINESSES USING GOOGLE

The third player: Google.

Great alternative for individuals or businesses, especially if your info lives in Drive and Gmail.

Try Gemini to organize your day or surface important emails—it works very well.

One big improvement I expect: Gemini in Gmail.

Right now it’s basic—too much at stake with the world’s number 1 email tool.

But once Gmail integrates AI to categorize and draft emails for you, you’ll never use email the old way!

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-19,"When not to automate in finance

Everyone talks about automation like it’s always the answer.
In finance, it isn’t.

Yes — automation can save hours, reduce errors, and keep processes clean.
But sometimes, it hides the very signals you need to see.

Some processes are better left with human eyes and judgment.
Here’s where I don’t automate 

→ Complex approvals
Large vendor contracts.
Strategic hires.
Capex that changes the company’s direction.
These aren’t “click approve” moments.
They need discussion, context, and often healthy disagreement.

→ Exception handling
Automation handles the 95% that runs smoothly.
But it’s the 5% of anomalies, an unexpected invoice, a duplicate payment, a pricing mismatch, where the biggest mistakes (or fraud) live.
Humans catch nuance that rules can’t.

→ Early-stage forecasting
When assumptions are shifting every week, you need to feel the numbers.
You need to run them, question them, break them, and rebuild them.
If you automate too early, you lose the instinct that comes from working closely with the data.

→ Board and investor reporting
A dashboard can show you the metrics.
But it can’t tell you the story.
The story is what changes decisions.
And stories are told by people, not spreadsheets.

→ Cash management in tight times
When runway is under pressure, no payment should leave without intention.
Automation makes outflows too easy.
Manual review keeps you close to every dollar leaving the bank.

If you had to pick one finance process to keep manual forever, what would it be?",50,24,,74,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_when-not-to-automate-in-finance-everyone-activity-7363572386517917698-1e0i,Default
My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-18,"The hidden costs of chasing “perfect” forecasts

Every finance team wants a better forecast.
Few stop to ask: “At what cost?”

I’ve seen teams spend weeks trying to perfect the model.
Every assumption debated.
Every formula triple-checked.
Every decimal “just right.”

And while the spreadsheet gets prettier…
The business stands still.

Here’s what chasing perfect does 

→ It delays decisions
Opportunities expire while you’re polishing the model.
Speed beats precision in high-growth environments.

→ It Creates False Confidence
A model can look airtight but still be built on guesses.
Perfect math on bad assumptions is still wrong.

→ It burns resources
Hours from analysts.
Meetings with execs.
All spent to close the last 2% accuracy gap, which reality will blow up next quarter anyway.

→ It kills adaptability
Perfect models are often too rigid.
The moment something changes, you’re rebuilding instead of adjusting.

Here’s the truth 
A forecast is a decision tool, not a work of art.
Its value is in how quickly it helps you see the trade-offs and act.

Good enough, fast, and adaptable will always beat perfect, late, and fragile.

The goal isn’t to predict the future exactly.
It’s to be ready for whatever future shows up.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-18,"If your team is still chasing attorneys manually, you’re not just losing time. You’re leaking revenue.

The way most clinics handle PI collections hasn’t changed in years:

- Spreadsheets

- Missed updates

- Slow attorney follow-ups

- No clarity on payment timelines

But here’s the thing— You don’t need more staff. 

You need a smarter system.

The most efficient clinics I work with aren’t just working harder. They’re working predictively.

That means:

- Tracking every lien from intake to settlement

- Getting real-time alerts the moment a case progresses

- Knowing which attorneys delay, reduce, or pay in full

- Forecasting expected collections with confidence

- Automating payment requests so money doesn’t sit idle

Most clinics don’t fail to collect because they’re careless. They fail because they’re stuck managing PI the old way—manually.

If you’ve ever said: “We didn’t even know the case settled,” or “I’m not sure why we weren’t paid in full”

It’s probably not your team. It’s your system.

If you want to plug the revenue leaks without burning out your staff, it’s time to upgrade the tools—not the headcount.

Gain,unknown,2025-08-18,"Traditional AR tools weren’t built for PI.

They don’t tell you which claims are quietly going stale—or which are ready to convert.

That’s where Lien Scoring changes everything.

What Should Your AR Stack Be Tracking?

It’s more than just balances—it’s about signals that drive recovery:

1. Documentation Status
 
    Missing LOPs or billing packets = denial risk
 
2. Legal Progress
 
    Filed vs. pre-lit vs. trial drastically shifts velocity
 
3. Claim Metadata
 
    Case type and jurisdiction = huge predictability factor
 

With scoring, each lien is benchmarked like a real financial asset.

You gain clarity on:

- Which liens are at risk?

- Which will likely convert?

- When to act and where to prioritize?

At Gain, we automate lien scoring across your entire portfolio—so your team stops chasing and starts forecasting.

Then go here to download the free CV: https://lnkd.in/e-RE-KKi

(Free but normally should be $27)

Here are my top 10 tips:

1️⃣ Add a Title:

Start your CV with a title that aligns with the job you're targeting.

This immediately tells the hiring manager that you are a relevant candidate.


2️⃣ Highlight Relevant Skills:

Ensure that your CV prominently displays the skills relevant to the job.

For an FP&A role, your budgeting, forecasting, and variance analysis skills should be in the spotlight... but don't list it as skill without explanation, rather, say how you demonstrated these skills.

For example: ""streamlined the budget process by reducing the number of iterations from 5 versions to 3 versions"" or ""performed an analysis on profitability which highlighted the need to increase the price of product X by 5% to maximize the profitability""


3️⃣ Quantify Achievements:

Show your impact through numbers.

Rather than saying ""reduced month end close time,"" say ""reduced month end close by 2 days"" .


4️⃣ Use Action Verbs:

Begin bullet points with action verbs like ""managed,"" ""developed,"" or ""implemented.""

This shows you're proactive and saves space.


5️⃣ Tailor Your CV:

No two jobs are the same, and neither should be your CVs.

Tailor your CV to match the job description and requirements.


6️⃣ Keep It Concise:

In most cases, your CV should be no longer than two pages.

Prioritize information that adds value to your application.


7️⃣ Proofread:

Small errors can suggest a lack of attention to detail.

Proofread thoroughly and have someone else review it too.

I have read so many CVs with obvious mistakes which disqualified the applicant.

Remember Finance is a job where attention for details is important ;)


8️⃣ Formatting Matters:

Keep your formatting minimalistic and consistent.

Proof check tabulation, bullet point styles, break lines, font sizes etc.


9️⃣ Software Skills:

Be specific with your software skills.

Instead of mentioning ""Advanced Excel skills"", highlight your abilities to perform Financial Modeling, create Pivot Tables, or use Advanced Formulas.


🔟 Focus on Recent Experiences:

Spend more space detailing your last two roles and be more succinct with earlier ones.

Recency often matters most to hiring managers.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-15,"Private credit sells itself as fearless capital.
Flexible. Creative. Risk-loving.
But watch what happens after the ink is dry…

Draw too much on your revolver — even for normal seasonality — and portfolio managers start to sweat. Ask to defer interest — and you might be told that’s “a suboptimal liquidity tool.”

The gap between the marketing and the reality is huge.
And nothing shows it better than payment-in-kind (PIK) interest.

• PIK lets a borrower skip paying cash interest and add it to the loan balance instead.
• In theory: risk-on, flexible financing.
• In practice: lenders use it mostly when a company is already under stress… and then treat it like a red flag.

I’ve seen the other side. Early in my career, I worked at a company that had a mezzanine deal with a PIK option that was risky by design. It sat under a stack of senior debt, paid a 12% floor with LIBOR upside, and the lender was ready to take over and run the business if needed.

That was exactly the type of risk they were built (and paid) to take. Today’s PIKs? A very different story — and a sign of where we are in the credit cycle.

Nicolas Boucher,unknown,2025-08-14,"CFO Mistake number 1: not using AI

Read further to discover the roadmap I have give to over 1,000 CFOs:
(the roadmap below is based on many minutes of transcripts worth thousands of dollars of consultation)

1) Foundation First — “Crawl”
Why: Before anything clever, make AI safe, accessible, and pointed at work data.

How:
- Pick the stack your company already trusts (Microsoft → Copilot 365; Google → Gemini)
- Issue professional licenses (not just to managers) and turn on meeting transcripts
- If you’re not on Microsoft, ChatGPT Teams gives SOC2-type protections and connectors (Dropbox/Outlook/etc.).


2) Quick Wins that Stick — “Walk”
Why: Early, visible wins build trust and momentum.

How: Start with 2–3 wins any team can repeat:
Auto-summarize meetings and extract actions from transcripts
Draft monthly review from call notes
 

3) Teach the Team, Not the Tool — “Organize”
Why: Licenses don’t equal adoption; cadence does

How:
- Launch a Teams/Slack channel for daily use-cases + Q&A
- Run bi-weekly “lunch & learn” show-and-tells.
- After 6–8 weeks, hold a 2-hour hackathon focused on building agents/GPTs for real finance tasks
 

4) Projects vs. GPTs — “Systematize”
Why: Consistency beats clever prompts.

How:
- Use Projects to hold client/company-specific files & context.
- Use Custom GPTs/Agents for repeatable tasks across clients (cash/flux analysis, email templates). Then call the GPT inside each project for consistent behavior. 


5) Data Foundations, Light — “Un-silo”
Why: Most pain is messy, disconnected data; you don’t need a new ERP to start.

How:
- Stand up a light harmonization layer: use Zapier (fast) or N8N (flexible/self-hosted) to sync keys and push clean events between CRM, support, and accounting.
- Apply fuzzy matching on org names/addresses; standardize a master table. 

 
6) Automate the Repetitive — “Run”
Why: Free up 20–40% of team time with safe, deterministic workflows

How:
- Use Power Automate/Office Scripts (Microsoft) to script repeatable flows: save attachments to SharePoint, transform Excel → PowerPoint, label emails, schedule reports.
- Let AI write the scripts; humans review once. 


7) Build Finance Agents — “Augment”
Why: Agents replace the human triggering AI by an automatic triggering: “do the thing when X happens.”

How:
- Start with agents for commentary drafting, classification, vendor form filling, or monthly flux notes
- Share agents internally so anyone can reuse and adapt 
- Tools: n8n, Copilot Studio or Zapier

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-14,"How great FP&A teams build trust with operators

Most FP&A teams think their job is to be right.
Right numbers.
Right variance explanations.
Right forecast.

But here’s the truth

Operators don’t care if your forecast is 99.8% accurate if it doesn’t help them make better calls.

Trust is built when your numbers line up with their reality.

→ Sit with them before you model
Understand how sales actually closes deals, how ops delivers, how product ships.
Your assumptions should match the ground truth not just last quarter’s trend line.

→ Speak their language
Don’t hand a GM a 20-tab Excel file.
Translate the numbers into metrics they live with daily: leads, cycle time, output per head.

→ Flag problems early
Don’t wait until the monthly review to point out the red flags.
A quick heads-up builds more trust than a polished report delivered too late.

→ Adjust when reality changes
If the operator’s world shifts mid-month, your model should shift too.
Static forecasts lose credibility fast.

Accuracy matters.
But alignment gets people to actually use your numbers.

That’s the difference between FP&A that reports and FP&A that drives decisions.

How do you make sure your numbers match the operator’s reality?",10,7,,17,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_how-great-fpa-teams-build-trust-with-operators-activity-7361768900117635073-AHVO,Default
Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-14,"Champagne sunsets for some. Spreadsheet marathons for others.
Offsites, late nights, and interdepartmental fights…

For executives, annual planning often means scenic venues, strategy decks by day, and champagne toasts at sunset — from the outside, the most wonderful time of the year (cue the Christmas music).

For FP&A, it’s different.

This is when the other kind of offsite begins — one that’s not on the beach. (cue the ""most wonderful time of the year"" — this time being an inside joke from FP&A analysts. IYKYK.)

The annual planning cycle has a rhythm:

• Leaders align on vision and big bets.
• FP&A translates them into a detailed annual operating plan — revenue targets, capital allocations, expense budgets, scenarios.
• Departments negotiate. Sales pushes targets, marketing wants more money, ops warns on capacity.
• After rounds of iteration, numbers lock and targets roll out. 

Cross your fingers that your board is on board.

For 10 years, I’ve lived this cycle start to finish.

Tomorrow I'm heading out on vacation, my tradition to rest up before the storm. My own (self funded) leadership offsite. It's important.
 
Because as exhausting as budget season can be, it’s also productive.

You get unfiltered conversations across the firm.
You see multiple perspectives.
You fit the puzzle pieces together so the company can succeed.

It’s not just about locking in numbers — it’s about stitching strategy to execution.

I’m signing off for the next couple of weeks.

This year it's a little bit different — I'm not resting to run a budget process, but instead resting to be there for you through your budget process.

I’ll miss you all, but I hope you get your own time of calm before the storm.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-12,"GPT-5 is basically mood roulette.
Yesterday it said it “nuked” 600 lines of code, today it’s all “thank you for your patience” — next it’ll be signing emails “Best regards.”

If I wanted that kind of personality swing, I’d hire two interns and make them share a keyboard.

* Yesterday’s “nuked” line came while it was failing a basic code update.
* One user described GPT-5’s tone as “abrupt and sharp … like it’s an over-worked secretary. A disastrous first impression.”
* Reddit is full of similar stories: blame-shifting, doubling down when wrong, swinging from sass to corporate-speak with no warning.

This isn’t “AI getting moody” — it’s model roulette. Depending on the variant you hit, GPT-5 can sound like:
- A sharp, slightly irreverent colleague who cracks jokes mid-project
- Or a corporate bot that thinks “thank you for your patience” is peak personality

Inconsistent tone makes it harder to use the tool predictably. One day it’s playful and collaborative, the next it’s stiff and formal — and that shift can completely change how you work with it.

If I wanted unpredictable tone shifts, I’d just rotate my human team on alternating days.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-12,"AI is easy. Too easy.
That’s why it can trip you up in finance ops.

With AI, you can skip the heavy lifting.
No standard processes. No clean datasets. No strict controls.
Just throw in your unstructured mess, and it will give you… something.

But:
→ It’s resource-intensive (translation: costly).
→ Outputs can be hard to validate.
→ And “probably correct” isn’t good enough when the numbers drive real decisions.

Machine Learning is different.
It forces discipline before you start:
→ Engagement letters in a consistent format.
→ ERP fields populated the same way every time.
→ KPIs defined and agreed across the org.

Yes, that structuring work is a pain.
Yes, it takes time.
But it pays off in accuracy, auditability, and cost control.

The most effective setups I’ve seen use a three-step approach:

1️⃣ Structured ML  
   • Handles repetitive, data-heavy work  
   • Low cost per run, high accuracy with clean data  

2️⃣ AI for Exceptions  
   • Tackles unstructured complexity  
   • More resource-intensive, adds flexibility & judgment  

3️⃣ Human Validation  
   • Sanity checks AI outputs  
   • Ensures compliance & accuracy before action

Over the years I have seen a lot of situations where ML was clearly avoided because it takes work. People seem to now be sighing a breath of relief as in some scenarios the AI can do that upfront work piece. But we should be very clear that taking this route has real tradeoffs and downsides. Sometimes you just have to put in the work.

Both AI and ML are game-changing.
The art is knowing when to use each — and in what order — to get the best result at the lowest cost and with the right controls.

1. Accurate numbers don’t win trust, useful numbers do. You can be 100% precise and still irrelevant if you’re not answering the right question.

2. Growth can hide bad unit economics for years. By the time you catch it, the fix is twice as expensive and twice as painful.

3.Overstaffing finance kills agility. A lean, sharp team with clear systems outperforms a bloated one with no direction every time.

4. Operators don’t read 20-tab workbooks. If your insights aren’t in their language, they’ll ignore them.

A peer asked me that when I moved into an ops role at a consulting firm.
They weren’t being dismissive.
They were being honest.

Most firms don’t have a model for back-office leaders to reach the top.
Because they still see ops as:
→ Non-revenue
→ Important but not strategic
→ Supportive, but not core

But here’s the thing:
Private equity is starting to bet millions on ops.
In some cases, they’re buying it outright.

If investors are building enterprise value in what you call “overhead”…
maybe it’s time to rethink who’s driving the business.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-07,"As leaders, we’re facing an inflection point—not just in how we work, but in how we lead.

With AI adoption accelerating and teams more distributed than ever, one question keeps surfacing in my conversations with operators, law firm partners, and service providers alike:

How do we design organisations that unlock—not erode—human potential?

Because here’s the paradox: 

Technology gives us unprecedented capability. But it doesn’t automatically give us clarity, connection, or culture.

The faster the world moves, the easier it is to lose sight of the people doing the work. That’s what I see most often in the PI space. Operational pressure keeps increasing. AR timelines stretch. Tech stacks grow. But morale? Alignment? Often moving in the opposite direction.

We can’t automate our way out of that. What we need is intentional leadership.
To me, that starts with three non-negotiables:

I. Lead with Purpose 
Every system we implement—whether it's for billing, reimbursement, or AI-driven forecasting—needs to serve a clear why. Not just “Can we build it?” but “Should we—and who does it serve?”

II. Build with People at the Center 
Efficiency matters. But so does experience. If your workflows are faster but leave teams confused, burnt out, or disconnected—you’ve just moved the pain upstream.

III. Create Performance That Actually Matters 
In too many firms, performance still means compliance and checking boxes. But the best organizations I’ve seen? They invest in clarity. Feedback. Growth pathways. That’s how you turn good operators into great ones.

Technology will keep evolving. But the real shift—the one that matters—is how we choose to use it.

The future of PI servicing, and frankly any professional services business, won’t be won by those who move fastest. It’ll be won by those who move with the most intention.

We have the opportunity to build something better: systems that are not only more efficient, but more human. That’s not a pipe dream. It’s a leadership choice.

So the question is: Are we designing systems that just scale? Or are we building ones that help people thrive?",7,,,7,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidzeising_as-leaders-were-facing-an-inflection-pointnot-activity-7359229366192480256-iAxi,Gain Company
My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-07,"What founders get wrong about FP&A (and why it matters)

Most founders think FP&A is about cleaning up spreadsheets.
Tracking last month’s budget.
Building reports for the board.

It’s not.

The real job of FP&A is to improve how fast and how well you make decisions.
Not just number accuracy, decision velocity.

If the only question FP&A is answering is “how did we do last month?”
You’re underusing it.

Here’s what great FP&A actually does 

→ helps you decide when to hire
Not just “can we afford it,” but “when does the ROI make sense?”

→ models what happens if burn increases 15%
Or if revenue dips. Or if churn creeps up.
The goal isn’t a perfect prediction, it’s a clear picture of risk.

→ pressure-tests new initiatives
Will that product line break even?
Will this expansion cannibalize margins?

→ helps you say no
Because not all growth is good growth.
FP&A helps you spot what looks great on paper but erodes long-term value.

→ turns instinct into strategy
Gut calls still matter.
But FP&A turns them into measurable, modelable bets with eyes wide open.

Yes, budgeting matters.
Yes, reporting is essential.

But if FP&A isn’t changing how you operate…
If it’s not shaping your next move…
If your finance team isn’t part of the strategy room…

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-07,"💼 PE Is (Almost) Buying Law Firms — Here’s What That Actually Means

Private equity can’t technically own law firms.
But it’s getting close.
Closer than most people realize.

Through a structure called a managed services organization (MSO), PE firms are starting to:
→ Acquire all the business infrastructure of law firms
→ Lock in long-term contracts
→ Control operations — without touching legal equity

It’s not ownership. But it feels like it.

More importantly, it validates something I’ve seen in every PE-backed professional services firm I’ve worked with:
→ The back office isn’t just overhead. It’s a value creator.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-05,"You don’t scale by doing more, you scale by doing less, better

It took me years (and a few battle scars) to understand this.

In early-stage companies, the instinct is to add.

More tools.
More dashboards.
More analysis.
More meetings.

At first, it feels like momentum.

But over time, it turns into clutter.

Clutter that slows decisions.
Clutter that hides the real problems.
Clutter that makes everything feel urgent when very little actually is.

And the worst part?

No one’s moving faster.
No one’s making better calls.
Everyone’s just busier.

Here’s what actually works 

→ Fewer KPIs but the right ones
You don’t need 40 metrics. You need 4 that move the business.
Pick the ones that show risk early and drive action fast.

→ Leaner teams but with sharper roles
Most bloated teams aren’t slow because they’re big.
They’re slow because no one’s sure who owns what.

→ Simpler forecasts but built on real assumptions
You don’t need to model every line item.
You need to model the decisions that matter most.

→ Smaller scope but faster execution
Velocity wins.
A focused plan you can execute now beats a perfect plan that takes 3 months to align.

Scaling is about subtraction.

Cut the noise.
Shrink the surface area.
Double down on what matters.

Because clarity compounds.
And the best teams don’t just move fast.
They move with purpose.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-08-05,"I didn’t step back from client work. I stepped into something harder. 

Internal finance.

And people thought I was out of my mind.

Back in 2020, I’d been on the Strategic Finance team at one of the top PE-backed OCFO advisory firms for three years.
→ I was the go-to for the firm’s most complex modeling and BI projects.
→ Bringing in real business from top-tier PE firms — years before my title said I should.
→ I had just been promoted to Director.
→ I was clearly on the path up.

So why raise my hand to go internal — to run finance ops?
To fix timesheets and build forecast templates?

Because I saw a firm on the verge of something bigger — and I knew internal finance could make or break it.

It wasn’t about plugging gaps.

It was about building a real operating engine:
 → A planning rhythm tied to actual goals
 → A long-range view that supported both organic and inorganic growth
 → Hiring models aligned to delivery capacity and margin
 → Forecasts that held up under board scrutiny
 → Metrics that didn’t just track — but shaped — performance

And no — I wasn’t worried about how it would look.

I had deep relationships across the consulting team. They knew me.
We’re still close — and the mutual respect never wavered.

I also knew: if I helped the firm succeed financially, the comp and promotions would take care of themselves.

And honestly?

It helped me stand out.

I got leadership exposure I never would’ve gotten on the traditional path.
(And let’s be real — the back office always seemed like it was having the most fun.)

Most firms assume that if they sell finance, they’re good at running it themselves.

But even the best ones underinvest in internal finance — not out of neglect, but because:
1️⃣ Top talent stays on the client side
2️⃣ Leadership assumes the model is “simple”
3️⃣ The role has no natural champion — it’s less visible, less prestigious, and harder to staff

But if you’re trying to scale and don’t have a finance function that helps you plan, pivot, and allocate — you’re just hoping for the best.

I didn’t step back.

I stepped into the part of the business no one else wanted to touch — but that held the key to sustainable growth.

Finance isn’t just what you sell. It’s how you scale.

If you're leading an accounting or OCFO advisory firm, here’s a question worth asking:
Has anyone like me ever raised their hand to build your internal finance function?

If not — why not?
Does it matter?

It did for us.

And if you’re serious about scaling, it probably matters more than you think.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-04,"If I could advise my younger self as a finance intern at GM many years ago, here’s what I’d say:

“Knowing the numbers is good.
Understanding how decisions actually happen, that’s better.”

The past few years taught me what textbooks never did.
The pressure. The pivots. The late nights. The tradeoffs.

From intern to CFO, the real learning came from asking better questions, over and over again.

If I had to distill it down, here are 6 things I wish I knew sooner:

1. Understand the business before building the model.
A forecast built in a vacuum will always break under pressure.

2. Spend more time listening to operators than perfecting reports.
The real levers of performance live outside the spreadsheet.

3. Don’t hide behind data. Interpret it.
Your job isn’t to be precise. It’s to drive action.

4. Learn to say, “I don’t know, but I’ll find out.”
That line builds more trust than faking it ever will.

5. Push for clarity, not complexity.
Great CFOs simplify. They don’t make things harder than they need to be.

6. Know when done is better than perfect.
In high-growth companies, speed beats polish every time.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-08-04,"Tort reform in Georgia just took a sharp turn—and it’s reshaping PI economics in real time.

With the passage of SB 68 and SB 69, we’re seeing a shift that mirrors tort reform playbooks in states like Florida and Texas.

At first glance, these rules may seem like procedural tweaks.

But if you’re a PI provider, attorney, or funder—the impact is anything but minor.

Here’s the short version:

SB 68 – The “Real-World Cost” Rule
Only actual payments can be counted toward damages.
Inflated medical bills? No longer admissible.
Seat Belt Use is Now Admissible
Affects comparative fault, especially in auto claims.
Anchoring Limits Introduced
Caps how attorneys present pain-and-suffering figures to juries.

SB 69 – Mandatory Litigation Funding Disclosure
Any funding over $25K must be reported, regardless of source.

What does this mean?
- Leaner reimbursements
- Increased scrutiny on liens
- Reduced leverage at trial
- And a significant shift in how cases are financed and forecasted

Effective Jan 1, 2026. But here’s the kicker:

Cases filed today could still fall under these rules.

So if you’re thinking “I’ll worry about this later,” you may already be behind.

At Gain, we’ve been tracking these changes for months. Not just to stay informed—but to help our partners adapt their models before the rules go live.
The cost of waiting isn’t just operational. It’s strategic.

Are you seeing similar shifts in your state?

When you start scoring liens by recovery probability—based on attorney behavior, legal stage, and documentation lag—you move from reconciliation to revenue intelligence.

Here’s what that shift unlocks:

- Faster, more accurate cash forecasting
- Visibility into at-risk liens before they go stale.
- Fewer surprises at settlement.
- More leverage when working with underperforming attorneys or intake sources

It’s not about more data.
It’s about smarter signals:

- % of liens past maturity
- Docs still missing
- Recovery variance by provider
- Delay rates by attorney

At Gain, we’ve helped firms make this shift—from static aging reports to dynamic recovery dashboards.
Because in PI, the question isn’t how much you’re owed.

It’s how much you’ll actually recover—and when.
Let’s turn your lien book into a forecastable asset.

Please reach out to me if you want a lien performance audit or demo of our Recovery Intelligence dashboard.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-08-01,"5 finance ops decisions that save you 10 hours every month

Most finance teams don’t need more headcount.

They need better systems.

Because the real cost isn’t payroll, it’s time wasted on broken workflows.

Here are 5 decisions that buy back hours (and sanity):

→ centralize your source of truth
Stop pulling numbers from 6 places.
One dashboard. One model. One set of clean assumptions.

→ standardize your review cycles
Random check-ins create chaos.
Set a rhythm, weekly burn review, monthly close, quarterly forecast.
Rinse and repeat.

→ simplify your chart of accounts
If your GL looks like a junk drawer, reporting will always be messy.
Group what matters. Archive what doesn’t. Build reports that answer real questions.

→ cut the manual steps
If someone’s dragging formulas across tabs, you’re doing it wrong.
Use tools that automate reconciliation, clean inputs, and trigger workflows.

→ decide what doesn’t get done
Not every report needs to exist.
Not every metric needs weekly updates.
Focus on decisions, not data for data’s sake.

Finance isn’t just about the numbers.

It’s about how the numbers flow.

What’s one ops decision that saved your team serious time?

Tax equity, ABS, 30-year circular references.
It made me a great modeler. It also fried my brain.

So when I moved into professional services?

But that era is ending.

Professional services firms, #Accounting and #Consulting, are quietly becoming… capital allocators.

They're building platforms. Investing in #AI tooling. Funding internal delivery infrastructure.
And with that comes something the industry has barely had to think about before:

→ ROI models that stretch across years—not weeks.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-31,"MD&A is the last mile. And it’s the hardest one.
Over the years, I’ve automated everything else in the monthly reporting pack—financials, KPIs, dashboards. The tech is there. So am I.

But I still haven’t automated Management Discussion & Analysis.

Not because I can’t.
Because I haven’t wanted to.

For a while, I leaned on excuses:
→ “The tools aren’t good enough.” (They are now.)
→ “We can’t put sensitive data into AI.” (Most companies are getting comfortable.)

So what’s left?

MD&A is the part that forces you to think.
You sit with the numbers.
You ask hard questions.
You turn noise into narrative and narrative into action.

It’s not just output. It’s practice.

And that’s what makes me hesitate—because once you skip that step, you skip the learning.

If we bring up an entire generation of analysts without ever asking them to take a stab at MD&A, how are they going to build the strategic muscles we say we value?

Can I automate MD&A for you?
Absolutely.

But think seriously about whether you want me to.
Some friction is worth keeping.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-07-30,"Every time I say “Sure, I’ll take a look”—a monkey leaps on my back.
You might know the metaphor.

In the classic HBR piece “Who’s Got the Monkey?”, managers are warned about a hidden trap: when you casually agree to “help” without assigning next steps, you’re not helping.

You’re adopting.

The monkey is no longer theirs. It’s yours.
And now you’re running a monkey sanctuary.

In PI operations, these monkeys look like:

– “Just let me know what you need to sign off.”
– “I’m waiting on the lien doc. Can you send it again?”
– “We’re chasing billing—can you call the attorney?”

These sound like team collaboration.
But if you’re not careful, they quietly turn into backlogs.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

You can’t scale a PI business if every monkey ends up on your back, or desk.

You need rules:
– Every task has a clear owner
– Every handoff includes the next move
– Every “I’ll help” ends with “but the task stays with you”

At Gain, we build workflows that stop monkey-hopping in its tracks.
Because when responsibilities are clear, time opens up—for care, for strategy, for growth.

If your team is juggling monkeys instead of moving forward, let’s talk.

Gain,unknown,2025-07-30,"Most firms are piecing together case updates, billing statuses, and collections data using PDFs, spreadsheets, and scattered emails. The result? A revenue plan built on guesswork—and hours of wasted effort from your team.

As you scale, the cracks widen:

- Different offices = different billing workflows
- Providers submit documents late or inconsistently
- No centralized claim tracking = missed settlements

Multiply that across 10+ locations, and suddenly your AR dashboard isn’t just misleading—it’s risky.

What’s the fix? Revenue intelligence.

Not just another dashboard. True revenue intelligence is a transformation in how data moves across your PI ecosystem. Think of it as a strategic stack:

1. Case & Billing Data – Legal progress and payments
2. Documentation Layer – Verified LOPs, payment requests
3. Predictive Modeling – AI forecasts cash flow and risks
4. Real-Time Dashboards – Visibility that drives strategy

The result?

- Go from chasing payments to confidently forecasting liquidity
- Spot cash flow risks before they hit
- Align legal, billing, and finance around a single source of truth

This is where Gain’s Revenue Intelligence Platform stands apart. Built for PI, powered by AI, and fully integrated with Filevine, Salesforce, EHRs, and PM systems—Gain helps you turn billing chaos into cash clarity.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-30,"What happens when there's no one left to promote?

The WSJ just published a sobering look at how AI is hollowing out the bottom of the white-collar workforce. Entry-level roles are vanishing across finance, tech, and professional services.

The chart says it all.

🟧 Professional services firms are laying off more bachelor’s-level workers than before the AI boom—even as the sector keeps growing.

Now, you all know how AI-positive I am. I’ve written plenty about the upside—especially for finance teams. 

But I’ve also flagged this risk many times before:
→ If you eliminate junior work without rethinking how you build talent,
 you don’t get lean—you get hollow.

👉 The value of junior employees isn’t just what they produce. It’s who they become.

Grunt work wasn’t just cost—it was apprenticeship. That’s how people used to develop judgment, pattern recognition, and domain fluency. You can’t skip straight to “trusted advisor.”

And let’s be clear:
→ Firms don’t invest in junior talent to be nice.
→ They do it because future capability requires it.

If we stop making that investment—because AI can do the work—we’re not just saving money. We’re quietly mortgaging the next generation of managers and leaders.

In accounting and OCFO advisory, the model was always:
→ Hire sharp grads
→ Let them learn by doing
→ Promote from within

If step 2 disappears—and we skip step 1 altogether—what’s left for step 3?

📉 This isn’t just a talent issue. It’s a future P&L issue.

👇 Curious—what are you doing differently to develop the next layer of leaders?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-30,"Most PI firm dashboards can tell you what’s outstanding.
But very few can tell you what’s recoverable.

And that’s a problem—especially if you’re a CFO trying to forecast cash flow in a system where payment timelines hinge on legal milestones, not invoice dates.

In my experience, most firms don’t have a lien problem.
They have a visibility problem.
Here’s what traditional AR reports miss:
- Which liens are quietly aging into unrecoverable territory?
- Where documentation lags are delaying recovery?
- Which attorneys, case types, or jurisdictions increase time-to-cash?
- Why “quick-close” cases are actually lagging 30–40% behind forecast?

This isn’t just a reporting issue—it’s a strategic one.
Because not all liens are equal.
Some are maturing fast.
Some are quietly going stale.

And unless you’re tracking maturity, legal progress, and document flow together—you’re managing in the dark.
The fix?

1. Score liens by recovery probability.
2. Track expected maturity windows by case type.
3. Flag high-risk claims based on attorney behaviour or documentation gaps

Forecast recovery, not just balances
In PI, aging is linear—but recovery isn’t.

If your finance team is stuck reconciling spreadsheets while revenue stalls, maybe it’s time to treat liens like what they really are: assets with risk, value, and timing that needs to be measured.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-29,"Ever feel like LinkedIn’s algorithm has a mind of its own?
Same. So I tried modeling it.

After posting about Claude’s financial services capabilities, I started tracking impressions manually—timestamps, screenshots, Excel, the whole thing.

📈 The pink dots are actual impressions.
🟢 The green curve is an exponential fit I created midday on Day 1 (dotted line marks 3:00 PM).

And weirdly… the post has hugged the curve almost perfectly ever since.
There were a few small deviations—like a slowdown around 4–6pm (as people wrapped up work), then an evening lull, then a late-night and next-morning bump. But overall, it stuck close.

Even more interesting?

This pattern—exponential decay with minor time-of-day noise—matches what I’ve seen anecdotally in many of my other posts.

And yes, at one point LinkedIn thought I was a bot and made me sign a compliance agreement saying I wouldn’t scrape data 😂
(Apparently I took this a little too seriously.)

But I can’t help asking:
→ Is this “decay curve” the norm for everyone now?
→ Have algo changes made posts more predetermined?
→ Or is there still room to defy gravity with the right engagement burst?

I’ve been in finance long enough to see the gap.

The gap between how finance is taught
And how it’s actually practiced.

Forecasting frameworks. Ratios. Reporting mechanics.

Is how it actually plays out in the real world.

Messy models. Short runways.
Board decks that weren’t ready.
Late-night pivots before a fundraise.

I’ve made the mistakes.
And I’ve learned how to turn finance into a tool for better, faster decisions not just cleaner spreadsheets.

That’s what this newsletter is about.

Real-world finance leadership.
Stories, habits, and lessons that don’t show up in textbooks.
The conversations you wish you had earlier.

No jargon. No theory dumps.
Just actionable insights from someone who’s been in the seat and still is.

The first edition drops this week.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-28,"🤖 AI for Finance Is Having a Moment. Get amped! Right? Right??? 🤔 

If you work in or around #Finance, you’ve probably felt it:
🚀 The buzz
📈 The demos
💬 The posts claiming analysts just got replaced by a chatbot

And now?

Anthropic dropped Claude for Financial Services — and people are losing it.
→ “Claude for Finance is here!”
→ “Finally, an AI for CFOs!”
→ “Say goodbye to Excel jockeys!”

But let’s take a beat.

💡 What Do We Actually Mean by “Finance”?
It’s one of the most overloaded words in business.
Depending on the context, “finance” might refer to:

🏢 Corporate Finance (the function)
→ FP&A
→ Accounting
→ Treasury
→ Internal Audit
→ Finance systems
👉 Reports to the CFO. Manages the business from the inside.

🏦 ""High"" Finance (the industry)
→ Investment Banking
→ Private Equity
→ Hedge Funds
→ Asset & Wealth Management
→ Insurance
👉 Deals with capital markets, capital allocation, and risk.
This is financial services.

🔍 Why This Distinction Matters — Especially Now
Anthropic didn’t launch Claude for Finance.
They launched Claude for Financial Services.
That’s not semantics. That’s strategy.

This product was built for:
→ Bridgewater Associates (hedge fund research)
→ Blackstone (private equity deal analysis)
→ Goldman Sachs (investment banking workflows)
→ AIG (insurance underwriting)
→ Vanguard (asset management reporting)

It connects to:
✅ S&P
✅ FactSet
✅ Morningstar

Not:
🚫 NetSuite
🚫 Workday
🚫 Adaptive Planning


🤝 But Is There Any Crossover? Yes — and it’s worth noting.

There is some overlap in the types of work being done. Claude FS can handle:
→ Complex modeling (DCF, scenario analysis)
→ Parsing dense financial documents
→ Supporting risk-style frameworks and simulations
So it may offer value to power users in a CFO org — those doing more advanced or adjacent work.

But here’s the catch:
📌 That’s incidental, not intentional.

Claude FS wasn’t built to optimize planning cycles, variance analysis, or close processes. It's built for an industry, not for a function.

It’s designed for capital markets professionals, not finance departments.
That distinction matters — especially when setting expectations or piloting tools.

⚠️ What Happens When We Get This Wrong?
→ CFOs get excited about the wrong solution
→ Corporate finance teams spin up pilots that underwhelm
→ Thought leaders misrepresent what these models actually do

📚 Want to Dig Deeper?
Glenn Hopper shared a thoughtful breakdown of Claude FS in his recent Deep Finance Dispatch newsletter. His take leans slightly toward the finance function side of the conversation, but he covers the capabilities and strategic implications in depth. Definitely worth a read if you're following the AI-in-finance space.

👇 Bottom Line
There’s incredible potential for AI in corporate finance.
But Claude FS is not that product.

→ It’s for high finance, not month-end close.

So let’s stay excited — but let’s also stay precise.

This is how finance pros create stunning visuals in minutes using ChatGPT:

Most finance professionals still rely on outdated templates or spend hours building custom dashboards and pitch visuals.

But the top-performing consultants, FP&A leads, and CFOs?

They’ve started using ChatGPT to generate high-impact financial images instantly.

❌ Here’s what happens when you don’t use visual automation:
- You waste time formatting slide decks
- Your insights get lost in spreadsheets
- Your audience tunes out from info overload

✅ Now imagine this instead:
- You deliver client-ready visuals in minutes
- You generate branded dashboards at scale
- You turn insights into action with less effort

Here’s a cheatsheet I created to help finance professionals do exactly that

10 Use Cases to Master:

1. Quality Infographics

2. Scenario Planning Diagrams

3. Forecast Walkthroughs

4. Client Dashboards

5. Process Improvement Diagrams

6. Storytelling Slides

7. KPI Pitch Decks

8. Visual Templates

9. Policy Change Explainers

10. Org Charts & Strategic Maps

Each section includes:
- A practical ChatGPT prompt
- An example output
- A ready-to-use visual format

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-25,"Most founders hire a full-time CFO when they need a part-time controller.

And it kills their runway AND their cap table.

Actually, let me correct that.

You don't need a part-time controller.

You need a part-time controller AND a part-time CFO.

Just not 40 hours a week each.

I've built teams across 3 continents. Led finance at both large publicly traded companies and privately held growth firms.

Here's what actually works:

Part-time Controller = 5 hours/week
→ Clean books
→ Burn tracking  
→ Month-end close
→ $150/hour. Zero equity.

Part-time CFO = 3 hours/month
→ Strategic planning
→ Board prep
→ Fundraising guidance
→ $300/hour. Zero equity.

Total damage: $50K/year for both.

Compare that to:

Full-time CFO: $300K + 1.5% equity = $1M+ true cost

For doing both jobs. Badly.

Because here's the truth:

A great CFO hates doing controller work.

A great controller isn't ready for board meetings.

You need both perspectives.

Just not full-time.

The smart scaling path:

Start with hours. Scale to days. Eventually go full-time.

It grows with your business.

Not your ego.

Controller hours increase first.

CFO involvement follows.

Both scale based on actual need.

Most founders get this backwards.

They hire senior when they need execution.

Pay for full-time when they need fractional.

Give equity when hourly works fine.

The result?

Burned runway. Diluted cap table. Wrong expertise.

What's your current finance setup?

And is it actually what you need?

Let's get honest below 👇

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-24,"I’ve seen a lot of “reforms” in PI over the years.

But Georgia’s new bills—SB 68 and SB 69—stand out for all the wrong reasons.
They were pitched as transparency measures.

Framed as steps toward fairness.

But in practice?

They make it significantly harder for injured patients to access care—and for providers to get paid.

The math is simple:

Fewer financial tools for patients

Greater administrative burden for providers

Reduced recovery potential for legal teams

For providers operating on thin margins, the risk just went up.

For plaintiffs, access to care just became more conditional.

And for everyone involved in PI, this shifts the landscape—quietly, but decisively.

This isn’t about theory.

It’s about real-world consequences that will start showing up in denied claims, delayed reimbursements, and discouraged providers.

If you’re in Georgia—or in a state watching closely—this is your early warning.

We’ve broken down what’s changing, who’s affected, and how to navigate what’s next.

Clarity matters. Especially now.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-23,"The 3 questions every founder should be able to answer about cash

You don’t need to be a CFO.
But you do need to see the ground you're running on.

Because most startups don’t die from bad ideas.
They run out of time, cash, or both.

And the warning signs don’t scream.
They whisper.

Here are the three questions that keep you from drifting into trouble:

1. How much cash do we actually have right now?
Not what the P&L says.
Not what Stripe shows before transfers.
Not what’s “coming soon” in accounts receivable.

Your real cash position lives in your bank account.
Today.
Not after you pay bills, run payroll, or settle taxes.
If you’re not watching it closely, you’re flying blind.

2. How long will that cash last under stress?
Most founders know their burn.
But they don’t pressure-test it.

What happens if revenue dips 20%?
What if churn creeps up?
What if that fundraise takes 3 months longer?

Runway isn’t about how long your cash could last.
It’s how long it will last once the real world starts pushing back.

3. What assumptions are we betting the business on?
Cash forecasts are only as useful as the assumptions behind them.

→ Are we counting on a sales ramp that’s never happened before?
→ Are we assuming pricing holds steady in a changing market?
→ Are we planning spend before we’ve proven the return?

The worst part isn’t being wrong.
It’s not knowing where you were guessing in the first place.

A founder doesn’t need to build the model.
But they need to know what it’s telling them and what it’s not.

Because clarity buys time.
Time buys better decisions.
And better decisions keep the lights on.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-07-23,"It’s 4 PM on a Thursday.

The ER is full. Imaging is backed up. A high-cost surgery just finished in Cardiology.

But your finance dashboard? Still waiting on payments from last month.

That’s the paradox of modern healthcare:
Plenty of patients. Not enough predictability.

For multi-specialty hospitals, revenue volatility isn’t a budgeting problem—it’s an operational risk. Salaries, upgrades, new hires—they all depend on cash showing up on time.

Yet every CFO I speak to says the same thing:

“We’re running hard, but the money’s always a step behind.”
Here’s why:

Insurance + TPA delays stretch claim cycles for weeks
Fixed costs stay steady while patient volumes dip
Manual, siloed billing creates gaps in AR visibility

Overreliance on one revenue stream (like elective surgeries) leaves hospitals exposed.

What’s the fix?
Not another band-aid.

It’s time for smarter RCM, tech-driven visibility, and diversified revenue strategies that make financial performance less of a gamble.

At Gain, we’re helping hospital leaders move from reactive firefighting to strategic foresight—and build financial systems that can weather the peaks and valleys.

Here’s how I’m preparing my own kid—and what I’d tell any parent asking the same question.

I have thought about this a lot over the last weeks.

The result is this: I have identified 3 future-proof path for our kids (and probably ourselves too!)

1. THE MEGA EXPERT
Their superpower: judgement
Mantra: “An AI can generate answers. I provide the right one.”

What they actually do:
- Spot when AI recommendations ignore real-world signals
- Choose the 1 insight that matters from 1,000 AI-generated options
- Add context, nuance, and “so what?” to raw AI analysis
- Catch flaws in AI forecasts before they mislead leadership

How to become one:
- Get a Master's degree or specialized certifications
- Become a voracious reader of foundational texts and research
- Find a master mentor with 20+ years in the field
- Practice explaining complexity simply

Hidden risk: Intellectual stubbornness


2. THE AI SAVVY
Their superpower: acceleration
Mantra: “I don’t work harder. I build systems that work for me.”

What they actually do:
- Build internal AI tools (e.g. churn-risk detectors from CRM data)
- Vibe code tools/apps with no-code + LLM APIs
- Launch outbound campaigns with AI-personalized messaging
- Automate workflows using LLMs and APIs

How to become one:
- 2h Daily practice with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Lovable)
- Build small AI projects to solve real problems
- Mastering prompt engineering (I have FREE infographics + courses about this, go to my page & follow)
- Think like an engineer: “Where’s the friction AI can remove?”

Hidden risk: Superficiality where you become a jack of all tools with no depth or impact


3. THE META HUMAN
Their superpower: influence
Mantra: “The best algorithm can’t close a deal or inspire a team. I can.”

What they actually do:
- Mediate conflicts between data and intuition-driven teams
- Present complex AI plans persuasively to the board
- Sense what AI can’t like human nuance, company politics, taste
- Lead cross-functional teams with psychological safety

How to become one:
- Study human nature
- Seek high-stakes communication roles
- Learn to lead without a title
- Practice active listening

Hidden risk: Strategic miscalculation—ignoring what AI can/can’t do and risking poor judgment

You don’t need to master all 3 right now.
Here is what you can do:
- Choose one of these 3 as your major
- But also one of them to develop as your minor

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-07-22,"How to build a finance function that doesn’t depend on you

Most founders don’t plan to run finance forever.
But they end up doing it longer than they should.

Because it feels faster.
Because it feels safer.
Because it’s hard to let go of the numbers.

Until the team is stuck.
Waiting on you.
And finance becomes a bottleneck, not a lever.

Here’s how to build a finance function that scales without you:

Start with visibility
You can’t delegate what you can’t see.
Set up basic reporting; burn, margin, runway that updates without you chasing it.
Make clarity the default.

Delegate the mechanics
Bookkeeping, payables, payroll, reporting cleanup, get it off your plate early.
These are repeatable tasks that steal focus from strategic work.

Retain the decisions (for now)
You don’t need to let go of every call.
But you do need a system for making decisions; forecasting, trade-offs, priorities without starting from scratch every time.

Upgrade from owner to reviewer
Move from building the model to reviewing the assumptions.
From chasing invoices to understanding where cash is going next.

Founders don’t need to run finance forever.
They need to design it so it runs without them.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-21,"A local clinic near my house recently put up a sign: “Now using AI to schedule appointments and answer patient questions 24/7.”

Ten years ago, that would’ve sounded like marketing spin. 
Now? It’s just smart operations.

We tend to think innovation starts in big hospitals or national law firms. 
But I’m seeing the opposite: Small, specialized providers are the ones quietly leading the charge.

Why? Because they don’t have the luxury of inefficiency.

When cash flow is tight and back-office teams are stretched, AI isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the difference between burnout and breathing room.

I’ve seen: 
→ Clinics tracking lien reimbursements in real-time 
→ PI providers cutting hours of weekly attorney follow-ups down to minutes 
→ Back offices run by lean teams—because the system finally works for them, not the other way around

This isn’t about replacing people. It’s about giving people better systems to do their best work.

At Gain, that’s what we care about: Clarity. Consistency. Control.

Gain,unknown,2025-07-18,"As a physician balancing clinical care with business leadership, you lead with precision in the operating room and vision in the boardroom. But managing both can lead to burnout if not approached strategically.

Here are three key strategies for physician leaders in orthopedic and PI-focused practices to maintain focus and energy—without sacrificing their well-being:

1. Prioritize like a CEO, think like a surgeon
 
Not every decision requires your full attention. Establish a decision-making framework that allows for quick, confident choices and delegate where possible.
 
2. Build a high-performing team
 
 Surround yourself with operational experts to handle everything from billing to case management. With the right support, you can focus on what matters most—your patients and long-term strategy.
 
3. Protect your downtime like surgery time

Block off time in your calendar for recovery. Set clear boundaries and avoid the temptation to let work bleed into your off-hours. Just like your patients, you need time to recover to perform at your best.
 

Leading a practice doesn’t have to come at the cost of your health. By implementing the right systems and support, you can maintain a sustainable balance between leadership and patient care.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-17,"“How do I break into private equity?”
I get this question all the time—from consultants, operators, and advisory firm leaders trying to work with #PE-backed companies.

And I get it. Because I asked it too—just not in the way people expected.
In 2011, during business school, I told a classmate I wasn’t going to follow the traditional path.

No banking. No deal team.

I was going to go deep into corporate finance—become the kind of operator PE firms would eventually need.

He laughed. Friendly laugh. It wasn’t a thing back then.

Operating partners were rare. Value creation meant cost-cutting and consolidation. Strategy lived in pitch decks. #Finance lived in spreadsheets.
But I believed that would change.

Years later, it did.

A friend called. He’d just joined a PE-focused advisory firm and thought I had the right background to join. That call kicked off a daisy chain of relationships—and before long, I was in the room.

Advising sponsors. Scaling finance. Helping portfolio companies bridge the messy middle between strategy and execution.

And here’s what I’ve learned from inside the machine:

✅ There is no front door.
#PrivateEquity firms don’t pick from formal vendor lists. They rely on relationships. Memory. Timing.
You’re either on the mental short list—or you’re invisible.

✅ Timing is never ideal.
You won’t get the call when you need work. You’ll get it when they hit a problem—if you’re top of mind.

✅ Partners aren’t always the buyer.
Directors and VPs on deal teams often make vendor decisions. They may seem junior on paper—but in practice, they run point. Don’t overlook them.

✅ Operating teams are your in.
The fastest-growing PE firms now have full-scale ops groups—some with 50+ people.
Their job? Fill gaps. Accelerate execution. Source the right outside help.
If you know how to speak their language, they want to hear from you.

✅ Backdoor access exists.
If you’re already working with a PE-backed company, don’t wait for an invite.
Executives often skip involving the sponsor—but looping them in builds trust.
PE firms appreciate visibility. And they remember the advisors who deliver with transparency.

✅ You might already be adjacent.
If you’ve worked with VC-backed SaaS companies, you’re closer than you think.
Firms like Francisco Partners, Hg, Insight Partners, and Vista Equity Partners own companies that look a lot like the ones you’ve already helped.

So no, I didn’t break into PE the traditional way.
But I knew the need.
I went deep in my craft.
And when the industry finally caught up—I was ready.
These days, I help others do the same.

Whether you’re:
→ A solo advisor trying to land your first portco
→ Building a new #OCFO practice
→ Or running a service firm looking to go upstream
I help translate operational expertise into PE relevance.

Manage your cash like fundraising will take six months longer than planned.
Because that’s what happens more often than not.

Too many plans assume:
→ Revenue picks up fast
→ Investors are quick to commit
→ The next round will land on time

But things get delayed.
Deals slow down.
And without enough cushion, hard choices show up fast.

Here’s the move:
→ Build your model with margin for delays
→ Track burn weekly not monthly
→ Know your true cash out date, not just your forecast
→ Make the cuts before you feel the panic
→ Keep a plan ready to stretch 90 more days if needed

Cash control isn’t about being cautious.
It’s how you stay in the driver’s seat when things get real.

Not responsibility
Not accountability

Control

Letting go of being the one who checks every model
Letting go of always having the last word
Letting go of being the only person who gets it right

Early on, control was survival
You knew the numbers
You built the systems
You were the system

But as the team grows, control turns into constraint
People wait for your input
Decisions stall
Everything flows through you and only you

That’s not scale
That’s a bottleneck

Great leaders don’t let go of standards
They let go of ownership
They build systems that work without them
They turn context into clarity
So teams can move without waiting

Letting go doesn’t mean stepping back
It means stepping up

To enabling the work

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-14,"Twenty years ago, I was in Greenspan’s chair. Literally.

Federal Reserve Boardroom.
About to do a roundtable AMA with Ben Bernanke.
Fresh off graduating Dartmouth with a degree in economics.
Invited to present my thesis at the Carroll Round, a gathering of the top undergrad economists in the country.

The paper?
“Deposit Insurance and Underlying Banking Sector Regulation: Does Deposit Insurance Cause Banking Crises?”
(I now need a translator just for the title.)

I was about to start at one of the top economic consulting firms in the world.
So much hair. So much potential.

What went wrong?

Today, I sit in a tiny home office.
Staff of 1 (first name: Chat. Last name: GPT).
The Wall Street Journal just described the kind of work I do — helping clients untangle messy spreadsheets — as “mundane.”

And I love it.

Maybe I would’ve made a difference if I’d stayed on the academic path.
Some do. We had dinner that night with William Easterly — a reminder that economists can change the world.
But I’ll never know if I would’ve been one of them.

What I do know is this:
In the path I chose — even if it’s not as polished or prestigious — I make a difference.
I help clients breathe easier.
I help CFOs and their teams level up.
I guide them from point A to point B when everything feels uncertain.

And sometimes, even in the darkest moments, that matters.

A CFO once texted me the day they filed for bankruptcy.
Not in anger or blame.
But to thank me — for helping him get clarity, and for being a steady hand through the chaos.
He was excited for the fresh start.

That text floored me.

So no, I’m not just an Excel jockey.
I’m a translator.

A partner.
A guide.

People move based on assumptions. Gut feel. Old habits.

— New laws introduced every quarter 
— Reimbursement logic shifting behind the scenes 
— Admin teams overwhelmed and under-resourced 

If you’re not seeing what’s actually happening on the ground, you’re already behind. 

At Gain, we built systems to cut through the noise: 

→ Track where reimbursements are breaking down 
→ Spot risk as legislation evolves 
→ Show providers what’s slowing them down—and how to fix it.

We don’t guess. We don’t wait. 

We build with precision. We validate fast. 
And we give providers the tools to do the same.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-10,"The WSJ recently covered the chaos of private equity recruiting — offers made before analysts even start their jobs, speed-dating interviews that stretch into the early morning, and new bank policies threatening termination for early commitments.

It’s a complex issue.

Yes, it feels ethically murky to accept a role while already plotting your exit.

But maybe that’s not entirely bad — it helps banks identify who’s truly interested in the job versus who’s just passing through on their way to PE. The same share of analysts were going to end up in PE and not at a bank at the end of their 2 years either way.

That said, these new rules may backfire.

If top talent knows they’ll be penalized for exploring other options, they might skip the bulge brackets altogether. And with many boutiques now matching on comp and prestige, that’s a real risk.

At the end of the day, both sides are stuck in a system that doesn’t make room for long-term alignment.

And calling financial modeling “mundane”?

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-10,"WSJ just published a piece on a truly disheartening trend: junior investment bankers abandoning their roles for private equity mere months after starting.
 
It’s offensive.
Not because of the ethics.
Not because of the recruiting wars.
But because…

They dared to call financial modeling and spreadsheet work mundane.

Excuse me??

As a proud Excel jockey, I’m here to say:
Those aren’t mundane tasks.
They are the sacred arts.
Crafted in the temple of Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
Refined over weekends, caffeine, and conditional formatting.

Now that we’ve addressed that criminal insult…

The article’s really about the increasingly chaotic world of PE recruiting:
Offers before day one.
Speed dating interviews that go until 3 a.m.
Policies threatening to fire analysts who accept roles at other firms too early.

I’ve worked with analysts on both sides of this. And honestly? I get it.

Private equity offers more prestige, significantly higher upside, and a seat closer to the action.

And banks? They’re burning out the very talent they rely on, only to be shocked when that talent walks.

But it’s a complex issue.

On one hand, it does feel a bit unethical to accept a job and immediately start planning your exit — especially when your current firm is investing in your development.

On the other hand, maybe this actually helps:
If someone’s determined to walk to PE, better to know early.
It clears the runway for folks who truly want to do investment banking.

Still, I wouldn’t be surprised if these new anti-poaching policies backfire.
Analysts may just skip the bulge brackets entirely — and head straight to boutiques, which are already catching up on prestige and comp.

We can joke about spreadsheets all day — but the tension here is real.

Curious to hear:
If you're on the recruiting or analyst side of this, have things truly cooled down?
Or is it just a new spin on the same madness?

In the PI world, we find patients waiting, attorneys pushing, providers juggling timelines and reimbursements.

But when things go sideways, people don’t look for the loudest voice.
They look for the steady one.

The one that says: “Here’s what we know. Here’s what we’re going to do.”
That’s executive presence.

It’s not about charisma. It’s about how others experience you—whether your team trusts your thinking, whether a client feels calm in your presence, whether people lean in when you speak.

Over 15 years, I’ve sat across from countless practice owners, law partners, and ops leaders. The ones who move the needle? They speak with clarity, lead with intention, and make decisions without panic.

They don’t raise their voice.
They raise the level of trust in the room.

If you’re building a team, managing crisis-level AR, or leading high-stakes conversations—presence isn’t optional. It’s leverage. And the good news?

It’s not something you’re born with. It’s something you build.

   ✅ Speak with purpose.
   ✅ Pause before you respond.
   ✅ Make people feel seen—even when you’re moving fast.
   ✅ Show up like someone who has thought it through.

→ Set the reporting cadence early

Monthly reviews. Weekly flash. Rolling forecasts.
Make consistency non-negotiable.

→ Say no faster

Does the word send shivers down your spine?
Remind you of the SATs?
Or worse — your next doctor’s appointment?

It’s what I call the first phase of my work with PE-backed companies.
A finance assessment — quick, focused, and built to accelerate.

It’s 2–3 weeks of hands-on work:
Mapping where finance stands today, where it needs to go, and what it will take to get there — without overwhelming the team.

But I get why the word assessment can sound… invasive.

This week, a CEO asked me:
➝ “Are you functioning as a diligence provider for the acquirer?”

And that made it click.

They weren’t just asking when I come in — pre-close or post-close.
➝ They were trying to figure out why.
➝ “Are you here to help me… or evaluate me?”

A fair question. Especially if your investors brought me in.
Especially if I called it an assessment.

So let me be clear:
➝ I don’t do diligence.
➝ It’s not an exam.
➝ And I’m definitely not a proctologist.

Whether I come in pre- or post-close, the work is the same:
Helping leadership align, build a plan, and scale without breaking the back office.

When I started Gain, I wasn’t just solving for cash flow,
I was solving for broken systems.

Because too many medical providers who treat personal injury patients aren’t just waiting on reimbursement—they’re drowning in administrative sludge.

➡️ 43 emails to chase a lien.
➡️ 12 phone calls to confirm a case.
➡️ A full-time team just to decode state-specific statutes.

And that’s before we talk about underpayment risk.
It wasn’t just frustrating. It was costing providers real revenue.

I’ve seen physicians turn away PI cases—not because they didn’t care, but because they couldn’t afford the paperwork.

It’s not about automation. It’s about orchestration.
So we built something different:

✅ A smarter workflow engine that understands regulatory nuance.
✅ A platform that translates legal and financial complexity into clarity.
✅ A human team that works hand-in-hand with your back office.

Treating PI patients should be a revenue opportunity—not a regulatory liability.

But personal injury revenue? That’s a different beast.

Settlement-based income is notoriously unpredictable—delays, reductions, and disputes can wreak havoc on your cash flow projections.

Here’s how top CFOs are gaining control:

1. Use Historical Collection Curves
Model PI revenue by analyzing historical settlement timelines and average collection rates per attorney.

2. Segment by Attorney Risk Profile
Not all legal partners pay the same. High-risk attorneys can tank your forecasts—track trends and build smarter assumptions.

3. Cash Flow Buffering is a Must
Build reserves for long-tail PI receivables and stagger spend around expected collections.

4. Leverage AI for Real-Time Visibility
Platforms like Gain offer predictive analytics for settlement timing, case aging, and attorney behavior—turning guesswork into financial clarity.

More predictable forecasting.

SB 68 and SB 69 aren't just policy changes. They're about to create longer wait times, fewer funding options, and more operational headaches for the 3,000+ Georgia providers already navigating an impossible system.

Maria's story in this issue isn't unique. She waited 18 months for settlement. Her provider closed 6 months before the check arrived.

This is the injury economy today. And it's about to get harder.

If you're a provider, attorney, or care about healthcare access in Georgia, this breakdown shows you what's really at stake—and what you can do about it.

The window for pushback is closing. But it's not closed yet.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-07-01,"What if the data cube private equity wants at exit…
was already working for you at year 1?

Most firms wait until they go to market to build a real data cube.

It’s always the same:
→ Rushed. 
→ Patchy. 
→ Hard to explain.

And by then, it’s too late to actually use it.

But the same cube private equity wants to see at exit?

It’s the same one that could have helped you price smarter, fix margin earlier, and scale faster.

So I built it.

A 10-year financial operating model for a fictional advisory firm:
→ Weekly time tracking
→ Headcount and FTE
→ Discounting, realization, utilization
→ Revenue built from the ground up

Not scraped. Not benchmarked.
Simulated.
Row by row. Week by week. 28,000 rows in total.

It’s the model I wish more firms had at year 1 — not year 5.
Not because it makes the exit cleaner (which it does).
Because it makes the journey better.

There’s more to build.
Projects. Promotions. COGS. Profitability by practice.
But the foundation is here.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-07-01,"In the early days of building Gain, I believed speed was everything.
Speed to decisions. Speed to scale. Speed to market.

I was convinced that urgency would separate us from the noise. And in many ways, it did. We grew fast. We broke new ground in medical-legal servicing. But somewhere along the way, I made a critical mistake.

I confused speed with progress.

I remember launching a new operational workflow for our provider partners. It looked great on a whiteboard. We rolled it out in record time. But within a week, it was clear—our clients were confused, and our internal teams weren’t aligned. We had optimized for launch, not adoption.

That was the turning point.

I learned that in healthcare, where the stakes involve real people and real lives—clarity trumps velocity. Implementation has to include context. Change has to come with communication. And leadership means knowing when to press forward and when to pause long enough to bring people with you.

Today, our approach at Gain still values urgency—but it’s paired with intention. We build fast, but we roll out thoughtfully. We move quickly, but we never leave understanding behind.

Wanting to be seen as “strategic” is a good instinct.
But too many CFOs overcorrect.

They try to say yes to everything.
They chase every project.
They step into chaos—without creating clarity.

Here’s where it breaks:

→ Saying yes too quickly
Support doesn’t mean agreement.
Smart CFOs slow the conversation down and ask better questions.

→ Chasing projects without trade-offs
If everything’s a priority, nothing is.
Great operators think in constraints—finance should too.

→ Trying to control more instead of clarifying more
CFOs shouldn’t hold the reins tighter.
They should make sure everyone knows which direction we’re actually pulling.

→ Confusing speed with leadership
You don’t have to be in every room to be effective.
You just have to design the system that keeps things moving.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-27,"When I first started working with PI practices, I thought better systems were the answer.

More automation. More templates. More workflows.
But none of it mattered when the attorney on the other end just…didn’t respond.

Or when the lien sat ignored for 18 months.
Or when the provider's revenue cycle got stuck in limbo—again.

It wasn’t for lack of effort. We were doing the work. Chasing. Logging. Faxing.
But the truth hit: in PI, execution doesn’t matter if you're not aligned with strategy. That’s when we changed our playbook.

Instead of chasing documents, we started building trust at the top.

We developed a POV—not just on lien servicing, but on how providers could protect margin and scale LOP-based care sustainably.

Then we did something most servicing firms don’t:

We yo-yo’d up and down the chain.

→ We met with law firm principals to understand their pressure points.
→ Dropped into case managers' inboxes to map their operational bottlenecks.
→ Then bounced back up with a shared roadmap: lower friction, faster resolution, better cash flow for both sides.

Now, providers weren’t just vendors. They were strategic partners.
And attorneys? They started bringing us into cases earlier—because we weren’t just helping them close files. We were helping them win. 

This isn’t about doing more. It’s about alignment and focusing on the right things. Because in the PI space, your leverage isn’t just your tech stack.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-06-27,"I once got laughed out of a room pitching medical lien financing to a national PI firm.

They said: “That’s not how the system works.”

I said: “That’s the problem.” Back then, the lien process was a black box.

- Providers were flying blind on reimbursements
- Attorneys were juggling a dozen vendors for every case
- Patients were stuck in the middle

I saw an opportunity to fix the infrastructure no one else wanted to touch.

Not with hype. 
Not with big promises. 
But with operational discipline.

We built Gain to make third-party reimbursement more predictable, transparent, and scalable.

It meant getting deep into the weeds.

- Mapping workflows from intake to settlement.
- Analyzing reimbursement variances by case characteristics, county, and third-party liability carrier.
- Building models that forecast case value using years of medical and legal data.

It wasn’t flashy. But it worked.

Today, the same firms that laughed now forwards our reports to their CFOs.
Hospitals and healthcare providers call us for proactive forecasts.

And when legislation like Georgia SB 69 drops—we’re the first call for impact modeling. This isn’t a story about revenge.

It’s about building what the market actually needs, even when no one’s asking for it yet.

The magic isn’t always in the idea.

It’s in sticking around long enough to prove it.

Great CFOs don’t just manage the budget.
They build the system behind good decisions.

Here’s what sets them apart:

→ They validate assumptions, not just numbers
A clean model is useless if the logic behind it is wrong.
Good finance starts with pressure testing the story.

→ They forecast based on business velocity, not calendar dates
Some companies need daily updates. Others monthly.
They match the rhythm to the reality.

→ They align finance with operations
The numbers don’t matter if the team can’t act on them.
Great CFOs speak both languages.

→ They translate data into action
Dashboards are easy.
Turning them into decisions is where the work is.

→ They use variance analysis as a strategy tool
It’s not about “what went wrong.”
It’s about what needs to change.

→ They always plan for “what if”
Every scenario. Every risk.
Because the unexpected always shows up.

→ Everyone knows advisory is where they should be going
→ But they don’t have the mindset
→ Or the measurement

Meetings were quieter. Turnover was low, but so was initiative. A junior team member finally told me, “It feels like we’re executing, not building.”

That stopped me in my tracks.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-25,"When I first started working with PI providers, I thought the right thing to do was say yes.

Yes to every lien.
Yes to every intake.
Yes to every case, no matter how complex.

Because saying yes felt like growth.
And in this business, growth feels like survival.

But here’s what that “yes” actually looked like:

✅ Hours chasing paperwork across three firms
✅ Revenue tied up in cases that went nowhere
✅ Teams burned out trying to fix broken communication loops

I thought I was helping.
What I was really doing was hiding from harder decisions.

The turning point?

When we started building systems at Gain that let providers say a strategic no.

✅ Not every case is worth taking.
✅ Not every firm is worth working with.
✅ Not every process is worth patching together with duct tape and goodwill.

We got them data that helped them ask questions like:
👉 Is a case aligned with their strategic priorities?
👉 Will the case resolve in a way that actually protects their revenue?
👉 Is the firm structured for partnership—or chaos?

And most importantly:

Can they build the operational muscle to say “this isn’t a fit”?

Because saying no isn’t about being difficult.
It’s about being focused.

It’s about protecting the time, the revenue, and the sanity of your practice.

If you’re still saying yes to every ask, I promise you:

You’re not scaling.
You’re drowning in slow-motion.

The strategic no is what turns reactive practices into high-performance PI businesses.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-06-24,"The 4 finance questions every founder should ask monthly

You don’t need a finance degree.
You need discipline.

Because most financial problems don’t start big.
They start small, then compound quietly.

Founders get busy.
Teams move fast.
And the numbers?
They usually lag behind the decisions.

These four questions keep you ahead of the curve:

1. What’s driving burn?

→ Burn isn’t the number that matters most. It’s the rate of change inside it.
→ Are we scaling headcount too soon?
→ Has CAC crept up while no one’s watching?
→ Are we paying for tools we don’t use?

Your runway doesn’t just depend on revenue.
It depends on how fast the money goes out and why.

2. What could break our margin?
→ Margins don’t implode overnight. 
They erode one discount, one vendor creep, one ops miss at a time.

→ Are we maintaining price integrity?
→ Are costs growing faster than revenue?
→ Is customer success driving retention or just delaying churn?

Margins are what make growth sustainable.
Ignore them, and you scale yourself into a corner.

3. Are we investing ahead of growth or behind it?
→ Are we being proactive or reactive?
→ Are we hiring to hit plan or to fix a team that’s already overwhelmed?
→ Are we spending for what’s coming or what’s on fire?

The best finance leaders don’t just pace growth.
They shape it with intent.

4. If revenue stalled today, how long could we survive?
→ This is the one most people avoid. But it’s the one that matters when the market tightens.

→ What if fundraising takes six months longer?
→ What if a big customer churns?
→ What if sales slows but costs don’t?

Runway isn’t about panic.
It’s about control.

It’s what lets you operate from confidence, not desperation.

You don’t need 50 dashboards.
You need four questions on repeat.

Ask them.
Answer them.
And adjust early.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-06-24,"COGS is a great KPI. But if that’s the first one you mention, we’ve got a problem.

I heard someone at an accounting conference say it was their top KPI—no hesitation.

And I’ll be honest: I bristled.

Because COGS isn’t actionable. It doesn’t tell you what lever to pull. It just tells you what happened.

But then I stepped back.

COGS **is** a good KPI. Especially in people businesses.
It’s fundamental. Necessary in indicating performance. Just not… sufficient.

And maybe the issue isn’t COGS.
Maybe it’s me using #KPI as shorthand for something else.

Because in strategic finance, we’ve already moved past KPIs.
We look at drivers. Levers. Actionable metrics.

The stuff you can change or use to change outcomes- your financial KPIs.

Meanwhile, many accounting firms are just now embracing financial KPIs—and that’s progress. But they haven’t yet moved into operational KPIs, let alone the kind of actionable metrics needed to guide performance in real time.

And here’s the tension: advisory services require exactly that.

You can’t advise strategically if all your metrics are backward-looking. You can’t help clients shape outcomes if you’re only measuring them after the fact.

But many firms are trying to leap from compliance work straight into advisory—without realizing how big the capability gap really is.

That gap isn’t just about tools. It’s about mindset, measurement, and the ability to operate in ambiguity.

KPI stands for “Key Performance Indicator.”
But let’s be honest—half the time it really means “Kinda Passive Insight.”

So yes—COGS is a good KPI.
But if it’s the only KPI in the room?

You’re not doing #Advisory.
You’re just reporting, with slightly fancier words.

So what do you think—should we retire the term entirely?

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-20,"When I started leading teams at MetLife, I thought team meetings were just status updates.

I was burning out my people.

Every Monday: ""What's your pipeline? What's closing this week?"" Twenty minutes of robotic updates while people secretly checked their phones. They were there physically, but mentally planning their escape.

I thought I was being efficient. Really, I was sucking the life out of the one hour each week where I had everyone's attention.

Then my top performer pulled me aside: ""Eli, these meetings feel like interrogations. We're not a team - we're just individual salespeople reporting to you.""

That hit different.

So I changed everything. I started first with three rounds of box breathing to get people present. Then I stopped talking so much. I assigned ""black belts"" - team members who owned pipeline tracking, marketing, and product updates.

But here's what really transformed everything: I connected the dots to WHY we do this work.

At Gain, when we're working with healthcare providers in the PI space, it's not just about processing claims. It's about a car accident victim getting care without their provider drowning in paperwork. It's about that provider going home feeling accomplished instead of overwhelmed.

When your team understands they're changing lives, not just hitting numbers, everything shifts.

Most leaders think team meetings are about control and accountability. They're actually about connection and purpose.

Your team doesn't need another status update. They need to remember why their work matters. Because when people feel their impact, they don't just show up to meetings. They show up as leaders.",4,2,,6,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_when-i-started-leading-teams-at-metlife-activity-7341869085539885058-9uNT,Gain Company
Gain,unknown,2025-06-20,"In personal injury, managing cases efficiently is critical—but often challenging. Providers traditionally face long delays, manual tracking, and communication gaps that lead to payment delays and administrative headaches.

Real-time case updates powered by technology platforms like Gain are revolutionizing how PI providers manage cases. Here's why they matter:

•⁠  ⁠Enhanced visibility: Providers get immediate access to case progress, settlement status, and attorney communications — all in one place.
•⁠  ⁠Reduced administrative burden: Automated notifications eliminate hours spent chasing updates or manually tracking cases.
•⁠  ⁠Faster payments: Real-time alerts on settlements and payment requests speed up reimbursements and improve cash flow.
•⁠  ⁠Improved collaboration: Seamless communication between providers, attorneys, and finance teams reduces disputes and streamlines case resolution.

The proposed taxation on litigation funding would dismantle a funding model that enables timely care, predictable cash flow, and sustainable reimbursement for healthcare providers nationwide.

This isn’t a theoretical impact—it’s direct and measurable:

- Providers would face increased bad debt.
- Patients would delay or skip treatment.
- Capital markets would pull back, fast.

Litigation finance exists to make sure injured individuals can access care now, not months or years later. We shouldn’t be taxing that lifeline out of existence.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-06-18,"The difference between a cash flow model and a decision model
Looks small.

Until you're forced to make a big call.

A cash flow model tells you what’s happening now.
→ Inflows. Outflows. Burn. Runway.

It helps you manage liquidity.
It gives you a view of risk if nothing changes.

But a decision model is built to test change.
→ Can we afford to open a new market?
→ Should we delay hiring until conversion improves?
→ What happens if churn creeps up two points?

A cash flow model keeps the lights on.
A decision model tells you if it’s time to build a bigger house.
Or if it’s time to protect what you already have.

One tracks performance.
The other shapes it.

And that difference matters.
Because most founders and operators stop at tracking.
They build models that show them where they are.
But not what they should do next.

A decision model starts with a real question.
Then it maps the trade-offs.
It forces clarity on assumptions.
It shows the range of outcomes before the money moves.

That’s what gives finance leverage.
Not just knowing the numbers.
But knowing what’s likely to happen when they change.

If your model only works for the current plan,
It’s not a decision tool. It’s a spreadsheet.

Great finance teams don’t just measure what happened.
They pressure test what’s next.

Does your model help you react?
Or help you think?

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-18,"When I first started working at the intersection of healthcare and financial operations, I underestimated the emotional toll administrative systems can take—on both patients and providers.

Years ago, I led an initiative to streamline personal injury claim processing for a network of providers. On paper, the system was airtight: efficient intake, precise documentation, faster LOP settlements.

But over time, I noticed a growing frustration on the clinical side. Physicians were spending more time justifying claims than focusing on care. Staff morale was slipping. And worst of all, patients were starting to feel like case files instead of people.

I had optimized the process but lost sight of the experience.

A provider finally said to me, “We’re delivering care with one hand tied behind our back.” That was the turning point.

From that moment forward, I started building with a new lens: operations should serve the mission, not just the metrics.

Today at Gain, our systems do more than manage third-party claims—they protect the bandwidth of healthcare professionals so they can focus on what matters most: patient care.

In leadership, we often chase efficiency. But the real question is—efficient for whom?

If you’re leading operational change, never forget that the people closest to the process are the ones closest to the pain. And when we design for them, we don’t just fix workflows.

We restore purpose.",3,1,,4,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eliezer-nerenberg_when-i-first-started-working-at-the-intersection-activity-7341108715258789891-znlc,Gain Company

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-06-18,"Everyone wants in on Office of the CFO. But most won’t make it.
The PE consulting market is shifting — fast.

Big 4 and MBB are building dedicated teams focused on strategic finance and the Office of the CFO.

The logic makes sense on paper. PE firms want more specialized, high-impact support. And who better than the Big 4 or MBB? Remember ""nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey""?

But here’s the issue: this work lives in a weird in-between zone.

It’s not pure accounting. It’s not classic strategy. It’s operator work — financial operators, to be specific.

That’s where most of these firms stumble.

🧮 Big 4:
They’ve got armies of accountants and controllers. But the mindset that thrives in OCFO work is anti-accounting:
 → It's scenario-based, not rules-based
 → It rewards flexibility and creativity, not rigid GAAP application
 → And ironically, many of the best strategic finance pros don’t want a Big 4 brand on their resume — it actually hurts their positioning if they want to be seen as value creators

🧠 MBB:
They’ve got the brains. No doubt. But can they shift from “strategist” to “operator”? That’s a much taller order.
 → Rolling up sleeves isn't just a metaphor — it’s the job
 → And let’s talk about pricing. OCFO support can’t command classic strategy rates. Will MBB play ball on that?

Here’s the part no one likes to admit:
 → You can’t build this with homegrown talent
 → You can’t train your way into credibility in this space
 → You have to buy your way in — fast. That may mean acquihiring. Paying up for people who’ve done it before, and letting them drive.

And that’s why firms like Accordion, Riveron, and CrossCountry aren’t scrambling to break in —
 → They already hold the high ground
 → They’ve built the teams, earned PE trust, and developed muscle memory doing this work across hundreds of portcos
 → New entrants aren’t leading a charge — they’re trying to climb a hill that’s already been fortified

If your firm is trying to break into OCFO advisory — don’t underestimate how different this work really is.

I’ve helped teams build it. And I’ve seen what happens when they assume it’s just “accounting, but faster.”

🧠 And strategy? Missing.

A WSJ article today confirms what most white-collar professionals already feel in their bones:
→ We’re not working longer because we love the grind.
→ We’re working longer because the actual work doesn’t start until after dinner.
🔹 Meetings after 8pm are up 16%
🔹 A third of workers are back in their inboxes by 10pm
🔹 Burnout mentions on Glassdoor just hit a 10-year high

And yet—most firms respond by slapping on another AI tool, another layer of “cross-functional collaboration,” or worse: another all-hands.

Here’s what I’m seeing inside professional services firms and PE-backed portcos:
→ Teams are drowning in complexity—while leadership focuses on utilization
→ Internal Strategic Finance is underfunded and underleveraged—because it doesn’t have billable hours
→ Workflow automation is “on the roadmap”—but 80% of core processes still run through Outlook and Excel

Not a deck.
Not a gut feeling.

→ What if revenue slips 20 percent?
→ Can we afford this next hire or is it a risk we can’t carry?

As you grow, the questions change.
→ Which product lines are actually profitable?
→ Are we scaling headcount faster than revenue?
→ What’s driving CAC down or back up?

Later, it becomes strategic.
→ Should we raise more capital or extend runway?
→ What’s the cost of entering a new market or staying in one that’s slowing down?
→ How does this business return capital over the next five years?

Cue the last-minute scramble:

✅ Syncing real-time lien statuses with providers
✅ Getting notified automatically when lien terms change

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-06-12,"What I wish more people understood about finance leadership

It’s not just about the numbers.
It’s not just models, dashboards, or budget variance.
It’s not just closing the books or updating the forecast.

It’s judgment.
It’s knowing when to push—and when to wait.
It’s knowing which assumptions matter—and which ones can flex.

It’s people.
It’s helping teams see trade-offs before they make the wrong call.
It’s protecting the business without losing trust.
It’s saying no—and still being invited back into the room.

It’s politics.
It’s navigating pressure from the CEO, the board, and the team—at the same time.
It’s telling the truth, even when the story isn’t ready.

It’s timing.
Because a great answer at the wrong moment can still cost you everything.

It’s communication.
Because clarity isn’t just a report—it’s a decision made faster.
And a decision made faster is a competitive edge.

Finance leadership isn’t about knowing all the answers.
It’s about knowing how to lead when no one does.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-06-11,"The case settled. The check didn’t arrive. Now the provider is 94 days unpaid—and counting.

This isn’t a billing issue.

It’s a cash flow problem hiding in plain sight across thousands of personal injury cases.

Providers deliver care upfront—MRIs, surgery, physical therapy—based on trust in the PI process. But too often, settlement timelines stretch far beyond expectation.

❌ Settlement delays
❌ Unclear lien status
❌ Lack of payment transparency

And it’s not just frustrating—it’s financially devastating for clinics with small margins and high fixed costs.

At Gain se, we’ve spent years mapping these financial choke points. Here’s what we’ve learned:

✔️ Transparency in case progress reduces friction at disbursement
✔️ Predictable payment schedules build stronger provider-attorney relationships
✔️ Accelerated funding options help providers avoid write-offs and retain capacity for the next case

There’s a better way to handle PI reimbursement—and it starts with designing the system around the realities of medical cash flow.

If you're a healthcare provider struggling to forecast revenue from lien-based care, let’s talk. Gain has built financial infrastructure to help you stay liquid—even when the system lags.

→ What breaks if we miss revenue by 10%?
→ How far does cash actually take us?

We stop reporting just to report.
We tie numbers to decisions.
Every metric becomes a lever—not just a line item.

We stop treating financials like a history lesson.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-10,"When I co-founded American Horizon Financial 14 years ago, I thought signed contracts meant success.

I was wrong.

We'd onboard a multi-specialty practice, celebrate the annual agreement, and pat ourselves on the back. Meanwhile, that same practice would process maybe 20% of their PI cases through our system. 

The rest? Still handled the old way - manually, inefficiently, burning out their staff.

I'd look at our revenue numbers and think we were crushing it... The invoices were getting paid. The renewals were happening. But something felt off.

Then came the wake-up calls. Three practices in one quarter didn't renew. All three had ""looked great on paper"" - paying customers for 18+ months. But when I dug deeper, the truth hit me like a freight train:

They never actually integrated our workflows. They were paying us to sit on the sidelines while they struggled with the same operational chaos that made them call us in the first place.

Here's what I learned: In healthcare operations, contract value means nothing if providers aren't changing their behavior.

Now at Gain, I track what actually matters - not just signed LOPs, but:

✅ Time from case intake to first payment
✅ Staff hours saved on administrative tasks
✅ Attorney relationship touchpoints facilitated
✅ How many cases are being processed through our platform monthly

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-06-10,"Most consulting/accounting firms try to scale before deciding what they are.
That’s the mistake I keep seeing—especially in accounting firms building Strategic FP&A or CFO advisory practices.

In my last newsletter, I wrote about why so many of these build-outs stall:
Misaligned incentives. No clear owner. Undervaluing what real advisory takes.

But here’s the deeper issue:
Even the firms that want to do it right often skip the most important question:
What kind of practice are we actually trying to build?
➝ Are we designing around client demand or internal talent?
➝ Are we going broad in terms of service/product offerings, or staying focused?

I’ve been working on a simple framework to help firms answer that.
It's already reshaped how I talk to partners, PE sponsors, and firm leaders about what “building strategic finance” actually means.

📊 Here’s a first look (no logos for now 👀)

Because here’s the reality:
 ➝ Your positioning shapes your pricing power
 ➝ Your delivery model determines your margins
 ➝ Your org structure defines your scalability
 ➝ Your service design either enables—or kills—recurring revenue
 ➝ And your quadrant? It’s what makes you platform-worthy… or not

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-06-05,"What I’ve learned working with founders across different stages

Early-stage chaos looks a lot like scale-up complexity.

But they break for very different reasons.

In the early days, finance is about staying alive.

→ Cash flow updates every week
→ Forecasts built in Google Sheets/Excel
→ Budgets built on instinct, not infrastructure

Founders need fast answers
Even if they’re 80% right.
Speed matters more than polish.

But once the company starts scaling
Everything shifts.

You’re still making decisions fast.
But now they impact 10x more people, 10x more capital, and 10x more risk.

The problems get bigger:
→ Metrics get siloed across teams
→ Forecasts stop matching reality
→ Systems strain under headcount growth

The habits that worked at $1M ARR?
They’re usually what breaks things at $10M.

That’s where strategic FP&A makes the difference.
Not just tracking performance
But helping leadership rethink how decisions get made.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-05,"The PI case that took 47 emails to resolve (and how to prevent it)

I recently reviewed a case file from an imaging center that involved a simple MRI for a personal injury patient.

From initial service to final payment required:

✅ 47 emails between the provider and attorney
✅ 12 phone calls
✅ 4 faxed document packages
✅ 3 different contact people on each side

This level of administrative friction isn't unusual in PI cases—it's the norm.

The fundamental problem? Medical and legal workflows were not designed to interface efficiently.

Providers who excel in managing third-party liability claims have built operational bridges between these systems:

✅ Clear lines of communication
✅ Designated points of contact
✅ Shared visibility into case progression
✅ Standardized documentation protocols

This isn't about providers becoming legal experts or attorneys becoming medical specialists—it's about creating aligned operational frameworks that acknowledge the unique nature of the medical-legal interface.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-06-04,"""The attorney never told us the case was settled 3 months ago.""

I hear this complaint from medical providers constantly, usually followed by frustration about lost revenue and wasted administrative time.

But when I speak with PI attorneys, I hear a different perspective:

""We notified the provider's billing department. It's not our fault if they don't have internal systems to track that information.""

This communication breakdown costs both sides dearly—delaying case resolutions, straining professional relationships, and creating unnecessary administrative burden.

The most successful provider-attorney partnerships I've observed have implemented:

✅ Shared visibility systems for case status
✅ Clear communication protocols
✅ Standardized documentation requirements
✅ Defined roles and responsibilities

When medical and legal teams operate with aligned processes, both sides win—faster settlements, reduced administrative costs, and better client/patient outcomes.

What specific steps has your practice taken to strengthen communication with your attorney partners?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-06-04,"""We're writing off about 15% of our PI receivables.""

That's what the CFO of a major orthopedic group told me last week.
When I asked how they calculated that figure, he shrugged. ""That's just our best guess.""

After analyzing their data, we discovered the reality was nearly double their estimate.

This isn't unusual.

Most healthcare organizations treating personal injury patients lack the specialized analytics to truly understand their performance.

The data blind spots typically include:

✅ Geographic settlement trends
✅ Settlement success rates by attorney
✅ Average time-to-payment by case type
✅ Write-off patterns across different injury categories

Without these insights, providers are essentially flying blind—making critical business decisions based on gut feeling rather than evidence.

The most successful practices in the PI space have recognized that standard healthcare analytics don't capture the unique dynamics of third-party liability claims.

They've implemented specialized reporting systems that track attorney performance, predict settlement timelines, and identify optimization opportunities throughout the medical-legal process.

The result? Dramatically improved collections and reduced administrative burden.

Medical malpractice claims over 250,000 lives annually. Car accidents leave millions with life-altering injuries. And many corporations consistently prioritize profits over people's wellbeing.

The personal injury ecosystem doesn't exist because attorneys invented it—it exists because real people need real help after suffering real harm.

For uninsured and underinsured patients, the ability to seek medical care through Letters of Protection isn't a loophole—it's often their only path to recovery.

The challenge? This system is under constant attack from well-funded interest groups who'd prefer injured individuals settle quickly and cheaply, regardless of what fair compensation might actually look like.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-29,"The conversation medical providers and attorneys need to have, but rarely do.
After 15 years working at the intersection of healthcare and legal services, I've noticed something fascinating:

Providers and attorneys each blame the other for the friction in personal injury cases—yet rarely communicate directly about improving the process.
The attorneys I speak with express frustration about:

✅ Inconsistent medical documentation
✅ Delayed response to records requests
✅ Last-minute billing surprises
✅ Difficulty coordinating with provider offices

Meanwhile, providers complain about:

✅ Settlement notification delays
✅ Poor communication during case progression
✅ Unclear documentation requirements
✅ Reduction requests without context

The most successful partnerships I've seen have established clear operational frameworks that address both sides' concerns.

This isn't just about better communication—it's about creating structured systems that align medical and legal workflows.

The result? Faster settlements, reduced administrative burden, and better outcomes for the patients/clients both sides serve.

What operational improvements would strengthen your provider-attorney relationships?

No one tells you how easy it is to become your team’s biggest blocker.

You think your job is to be the decision-maker.
To review every model.
To sign off on every number.

But control doesn’t create scale.

Trust does.

Because if your team waits for you to weigh in,
They’re not operating—they’re pausing.

If every forecast needs your eyes,
It’s not a system. It’s a bottleneck.

And if the team only moves when you do,
You haven’t built finance. You’ve built dependence.

So I changed how I lead.
I stopped holding the playbook.
And started teaching the principles behind it.

That’s when everything shifted:
→ People made decisions without waiting
→ Process improved without my approval
→ Strategy moved forward while I stepped back

The best CFOs don’t build teams that need them.
They build systems that outlast them.",18,9,,27,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_how-to-build-a-finance-team-that-can-run-activity-7333507130731180032-03qS,Default

I’m going to keep doing it here.

Not because I’m anti-flexibility.
Not because amazing finance leaders can’t work part-time.
But because the role of #CFO today is fundamentally not #Fractional.

In fact, it’s barely even singular.

Modern CFOs are expected to be:
 → Strategic partners to the CEO
 → Operators who keep the business running
 → Storytellers for the board
 → Systems experts
 → Team builders
 → Data translators
 → Industry savants
 → Risk managers
 → Capital markets pros
 → Oh, and sometimes HR and Legal too

That’s 1.5 to 2 FTEs. Minimum.

If you happen to find one person who checks every box? Congrats—you’ve found a unicorn.

And they’re going to cost you $2M a year, if you can even convince them to take your call.

So what’s the better play?

Find the 1.5x CFO.
The strategic, experienced leader who can own the function and build the team.

Then augment them.

Bring in a thought partner who levels them up—not with slide decks, but with targeted experience that fills the gaps.

For example:
→ You’ve hired a killer CFO.
→ They’ve scaled SaaS companies. 
→ They know systems, strategy, and how to lead.
Only problem? You’re a professional services firm. And they’re out of their element.

Don’t go looking for the exact same CFO with a services background.
You won’t find them. Or if you do, you’ll wait six months and overpay.

Instead:
→ Pair them with someone who’s lived in this space.
→ Who’s helped accounting firms, consulting firms, and people-based businesses scale.
→ Someone who can accelerate their ramp, pressure-test decisions, and spot pitfalls early.

That’s what I do.
I’m not a “fractional CFO.”
I’m the CFO’s thought partner.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-05-27,"The personal injury healthcare ecosystem is fundamentally broken. Here's what needs to change:

For too long, we've accepted a system where:

✅ Patients struggle to access care despite legitimate injuries
✅ Providers wait years for reimbursement
✅ Attorneys spend more time managing medical issues than legal ones
✅ Insurance companies delay settlements by design

And everyone loses except the insurance companies.

The solution isn't Band-Aids—it's reimagining how this entire ecosystem functions.

That starts with technology that creates transparency between providers and attorneys. It continues with structured servicing that replaces manual spreadsheets and missed payments. And it culminates in AI-driven solutions that predict settlement timelines and optimize cash flow.

I founded Gain because I believe injured patients deserve access to quality healthcare, regardless of their insurance status or economic situation.

But delivering on that vision requires more than good intentions—it demands sophisticated systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface.

This blind spot creates major financial implications:

✅ Cash flow forecasting errors
✅ Inaccurate aging assumptions
✅ Misallocated collection resources
✅ Understated write-off risks

Traditional RCM systems weren't designed for the unique dynamics of third-party liability claims, where payment timelines are driven by legal processes rather than insurance adjudication.

The most sophisticated healthcare organizations have implemented specialized operational frameworks that complement their standard RCM processes, giving them visibility into:

✅ Case-specific settlement tracking
✅ Attorney relationship management

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-22,"""Our attorneys handle the settlement tracking. We just provide the care.""

This statement from a spine surgeon perfectly captures why so many medical providers struggle with personal injury cases.

It represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the medical-legal interface.
The reality? When providers take a passive role in third-party liability claim management, they experience:

✅ Longer payment cycles (average 8-14 months)
✅ Higher write-off rates (typically 15-30%)
✅ Increased administrative burden chasing updates
✅ Unpredictable cash flow and revenue forecasting

The most successful practices in the PI space take ownership of the entire process by implementing specialized servicing systems—maintaining critical visibility without creating administrative nightmares.

These providers aren't trying to do attorneys' jobs. They're implementing operational frameworks that create alignment between medical care and legal processes.

At Gain, our AI-driven platform bridges this gap by automating case tracking, streamlining settlement visibility, and optimizing the entire revenue cycle for personal injury claims.

The result? Shorter payment cycles, lower write-offs, and dramatically improved profitability—without the administrative headache.

This scene from years ago shaped how I think about finance transformation. Too many brilliant FP&A professionals are trapped in what I call ""Scorekeeper Syndrome"" - producing reports nobody reads while executives make decisions without them.
It's not about competence. It's about mindset.
After 20+ years transforming finance functions at Coca-Cola, Expedia, GM, and beyond, I've seen the pattern: teams buried in reconciliations instead of shaping strategy. The breakthrough happens when you shift from ""what happened?"" to ""what should we do about it?""
My two cents: Finance teams that embrace strategic partnership don't just support decisions - they shape them.

Processes that exist because “we’ve always done it.”
Problems that should be solved by someone else.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-05-21,"Georgia's SB68 just made it dramatically more dangerous for healthcare providers to treat personal injury patients.

By eliminating collateral source protections, this legislation allows insurance companies to argue that providers should only be paid at Medicare or Medicaid rates—even for patients who were never on these programs.

Let's be clear about what this means:

When a doctor treats an uninsured accident victim on a Letter of Protection, they're taking significant financial risk. They provide care now, trusting they'll be paid fairly when the case settles—which could take years.

SB68 dramatically increases that risk by allowing insurers to cherry-pick the lowest possible reimbursement rates as ""evidence"" of what's reasonable, regardless of the actual market rate for those services.

The result? 

Many providers will simply stop accepting PI patients altogether.

At Gain, we've built infrastructure specifically designed to help providers navigate this challenging landscape—with data-driven approaches, risk management tools, and compliant servicing solutions that protect both providers and patients.

Nate Saperia,nathansaperia,2025-05-20,"Brutal truth: Most PE-backed finance teams are underperforming. Badly.

Not just falling short. Failing to deliver the bare minimum that the sponsor expects. And more importantly, what the business needs to scale.

From the outside, it all looks the same:
→ Reporting is late
→ Insights are missing
→ Errors show up in board decks
→ Turnover is high

To the sponsor, it’s often indistinguishable from incompetence.

But those are just symptoms.

And turnover? It's not just a symptom—it's one of the clearest warning signs that something deeper is broken.

I’ve seen this from both sides—leading FP&A inside PE-backed firms, and advising dozens more from the outside.

And here’s the thing:
You can have great people in the seats… and still have bad performance.

Let's talk onions for a minute.

What does any of this have to do with an onion you ask? Let's start peeling away.

I was once brought in to fix a reporting model nicknamed “The Onion.”

Why “The Onion”?
Because it had so many layers to peel back.
→ 100 tabs.
→ 1,000 hard-codes.
And every layer you peeled back just made you cry more.

This Frankenstein spreadsheet had been handed down from one FP&A lead to the next—just one example of how good people inherit broken systems like a game of hot potato. (Or hot onion.)

Was it the fault of the last person holding it?
Absolutely not.

Did they still get blamed when things broke?
Absolutely.

The real issue wasn’t the analyst.
It was the environment.
→ Institutional knowledge walked out the door
→ Legacy systems hadn’t kept up
→ The team was buried in reactive tasks
→ No one had time to step back and fix the root

So if your finance team isn’t hitting the mark, don’t jump to conclusions.

Start with these questions:
💬 What expectations were set?
⚙️ What systems are they working with?
📉 What’s actually getting in their way?

Because “underperforming” teams are usually just overwhelmed—by the environment, not a lack of skill.

Eliezer Nerenberg,eliezer-nerenberg,2025-05-20,"The hidden variable that determines whether PI cases help or hurt your practice
After analyzing hundreds of medical practices' performance in the personal injury space, I've identified a counterintuitive pattern:

The financial success of a PI practice has less to do with case volume or reimbursement rates than with one critical factor: operational design.

I recently compared two imaging centers with nearly identical:

✅ Equipment and technology
✅ Geographic markets
✅ Reimbursement agreements
✅ PI case volume

Yet one was thriving while the other considered abandoning personal injury cases entirely.

The difference? 

Their operational approach to the medical-legal interface. The struggling practice used traditional RCM systems for PI cases. The successful one had implemented specialized servicing solutions designed specifically for third-party liability claims.

In our analysis at Gain, we've observed that practices with specialized PI servicing solutions typically achieve higher collection rates and significantly faster settlement times compared to those using traditional RCM systems for PI cases.

At Gain, we've built our AI-driven platform precisely for this purpose—to transform how healthcare providers manage the complex PI revenue cycle, bridging the gap between medical care and legal processes.

In the PI space, your systems determine your success more than any other factor. The right operational framework doesn't just improve collections—it fundamentally changes the economics of personal injury cases for your practice.

→ Incentives tied directly to cash flow, not vanity metrics.
→ Performance triggers that balance short-term wins with long-term foundation.

→ A revenue stream you can forecast with confidence.
→ A pipeline you can bank strategic decisions on.
→ A team motivated to bring in the deals that actually matter to the P&L.

3. You demonstrate what finance is really about.
→ While others see CFOs as cost controllers.
→ While competitors treat finance as the “no” department.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-05-19,"Three truths about the personal injury healthcare space that most providers don't want to hear:

1) Your ""higher reimbursement rates"" are mostly a mirage if you're tracking PI cases on spreadsheets. The administrative burden, delayed payments, and inevitable write-offs are consuming those margins.

2) Insurance companies aren't just randomly difficult—they're strategically difficult. Their tactics are designed to force settlements by exhausting everyone involved, including medical providers.

3) The practices that thrive in the PI space don't just treat differently—they operate differently. They've built systems specifically engineered for the medical-legal interface.

After spending years in this industry, I've watched countless healthcare providers enter the PI space attracted by higher reimbursement rates, only to retreat when the operational complexity overwhelms their standard workflows.

The providers who succeed have embraced specialized technology, third-party servicing partnerships, and medical-legal communication protocols that align with how PI cases actually progress.

The good news? These challenges are solvable. The providers who tackle them aren't just surviving in the PI space—they're thriving, with collection rates 25-30% higher than those using traditional RCM approaches.

What's your biggest operational challenge when handling PI claims?

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-05-15,"Nothing irritates me more than ""this is how it's always been done"" in finance.

These seven words have killed more financial transformation than any budget cut.

Trapped more CFOs in the past than any legacy system.

And kept finance teams reporting history instead of shaping the future.

Here's what happens when this thinking takes over finance 

→ FP&A becomes backward-looking.

Teams produce the same reports quarter after quarter.

They track lagging indicators instead of leading ones.

They measure what happened instead of influencing what comes next.

→ Finance stays in the back office.
While the business needs financial partners.

While decisions are made without data.

While opportunities slip through the cracks.

→ Manual processes drain all the energy.
Month-end close takes 15 days instead of 5.

Forecasts are 85% accurate when they could be 99%.

Teams waste days building spreadsheets instead of insights.

The most dangerous phrase in finance isn't ""we missed our numbers.""

It's ""we've always closed the books this way.""
Great finance leaders don't preserve processes.

They preserve financial integrity.

They don't protect systems.

They protect business visibility.

And they know that sometimes the most innovative thing a CFO can do is break the finance function before the market breaks the business.

 Don’t say, “We can’t afford this.”

 Say, “We can do this, but here’s what we’re giving up.”

 Make the invisible visible.

 Shift the conversation from approval to choice.

→ Offer alternatives
 Sometimes it’s not a no.

 It's “not like this.”

→ Start with a contractor instead of a full-time hire.

→ Phase the spend across two quarters instead of one.

 The best finance decisions aren’t rejections.

 They’re redesigns.

→ Make it a shared decision

 Ask: “What’s your real priority here?”

 Bring the other person into the tradeoff.

 Not to shift responsibility, but to build alignment.

 When people help shape the answer, they’re more likely to trust it.

 The hardest part of this job isn’t the math.

He’s probably out for the playoffs. Maybe longer. The Celtics’ hope for a repeat championship are likely dashed. And while that changes everything for the team, it changes much more for him.

but not because they earned it.

If you're being pitched by one, heads up: a title upgrade is coming.

Here comes the rise of the Fractional Operating Partner.

And it's not backed by new skills—just higher pricing.

Many of my former colleagues have become real #OperatingPartners and I have huge respect for that.

It's an elite role and something they should be proud of. It takes blood, sweat, and tears to get there and to stay there.

This post isn’t about them.

It’s about the rebranders.

First, Controllers became “Fractional CFOs.”
Why? Because CFOs charge more.

Now? The next evolution is here:
“Fractional Operating Partner.”

Because in the comp hierarchy: Operating Partner > CFO > Controller.
New title. Higher rate. Same deliverables.

I’ve done the real work—
→ Advised PE-backed CFOs through scale.
→ Sat in the boardroom. Turned VCPs into execution.
→ I’ve had real Operating Partner conversations with PE firms.

I passed—for now.

Not because the roles weren’t compelling.
Not because the money wasn't there. Trust me, it was.
But because I saw a different path to drive value across firms, not just one.
(But hey—PE folks reading this, my number still works. 📱😉)

So when “fractional OP” starts showing up in your inbox, ask yourself:
→ Did the value-add change?
→ Or just the comp expectations?

And hey, don't judge me if you see ""Fractional Operating Partner"" in my title soon. Just know it's legit.

– Ship tools that solve real problems
– Iterate based on feedback
– Measure adoption and outcomes

That means:
 → Every forecast should tie back to decisions, not just reporting.
 → Every dashboard should answer a live business question, not just look clean.
 → Every process should reduce friction, not add bureaucracy.

This statement from a pain management practice owner perfectly captures the operational paradox I see constantly in the medical-legal space.

They're drowning in administrative work tracking third-party liability claims, yet ""too busy"" to implement systems that would eliminate that very burden.

It's like being too busy bailing water to patch the hole in your boat.

The reality is that practices in the PI space face a critical choice:

✅ Continue the cycle of reactive, manual processes that consume staff time and create unpredictable cash flow.

✅ Invest in specialized servicing systems designed specifically for the medical-legal interface

One approach perpetuates the operational chaos. The other transforms PI cases from administrative headaches into predictable, profitable revenue streams.

The most successful practices I work with chose the second path and never looked back.

→ Are win rates consistent across segments?

→ Is growth being driven by efficiency or headcount?

Last month, I sat down with the partners of a busy orthopaedic group. On paper, they were crushing it—27% growth year over year and expanding their PI caseload.

But something wasn't adding up in their finances.
I asked three simple questions:

1.- What does your average case settled for?
2.- Once you factor in bad debt, what does that number drop to?
3.- What is your total average of monthly Billable receivables specific to PI?

You'll be shocked to know how many Doctors or Practice Managers do not have these answers.

After 15 years in this business every doctor makes the same exact mistake, they think because their last case or cases settled at 60% of bill charges that means that's what they are averaging, and they couldn't be more wrong. 

Once you factor in the bad debit it on averages drops their percentages by almost 15-20 % and that's precisely where we step in and can help.

This is just one example of many of a practice that had invested millions in cutting-edge medical technology and clinical training but were using the same administrative processes for PI cases as they did in 2005.

At least until they build operational systems specifically designed for the medical-legal interface.

Controversial? Maybe. But after seeing hundreds of practices struggle with PI cases, I'm convinced:

Using standard practice management approaches for third-party liability claims is like trying to play football with baseball rules.

You might occasionally score, but mostly you'll just be frustrated and confused.
The practices thriving in the PI space have:

✅ Dedicated case servicing protocols
✅ Strategic attorney relationship systems
✅ Financial solutions tailored to extended settlement timelines
✅ Documentation frameworks aligned with legal requirements

That's the question I asked a neurosurgery practice CEO last week. His response? A frustrated laugh.

""I have absolutely no idea. My staff spends hours every week trying to figure that out.""

This practice generates over $5 million annually from personal injury cases. Yet they track these valuable assets using spreadsheets, sticky notes, and heroic efforts from an overwhelmed billing team.

It's a scenario I've seen hundreds of times across specialties:

✅ Advanced systems for insurance billing
✅ Sophisticated clinical protocols for patient care
✅ State-of-the-art medical equipment throughout the facility

But when it comes to managing third-party liability claims? Stone Age approaches.

The most successful practices in the PI space have recognized that the medical-legal interface requires specialized operational systems—not just modified insurance billing processes.

After 15 years working with practices in the PI space, I've noticed something fascinating:

This operational disconnect typically costs practices between $350-750K annually through:

✅ Lost time chasing settlement status
✅ Preventable write-offs from documentation gaps
✅ Reduced collections from inefficient attorney coordination

Yet these same practices resist implementing specialized systems because... ""that's just how PI cases work.""

More headcount doesn’t mean more output.

But most companies still treat hiring like the solution to every finance problem.

Something breaks? Hire.
Report’s late? Hire.
Too many spreadsheets? Hire.

Until suddenly, you’ve got a bloated team doing low-impact work—
And no one actually moving the business forward.

Here’s where it goes wrong 

→ Hiring before fixing the process
If your reporting workflow is broken, adding more people just spreads the mess faster.

→ No automation, no leverage
You don’t need more analysts.
You need better tools, and people who know how to use them.

→ Role confusion across the team
When everyone owns everything, no one owns anything.
Clear roles = clean output.

→ Scaling tasks instead of building systems
You don’t hire for what’s on fire today.
You hire for what the business will need six months from now.

As a CFO, my job is to see what others don’t, and trust me, operators often miss these critical signs.

Here are the finance red flags you need to catch early

→ Revenue Growing, But Cash Declining
 It’s easy to get excited when revenue is up. 

But if cash flow is going the opposite direction, you're heading toward trouble. 
Growth without cash is a ticking time bomb.

→ Margin “Improvements” That Aren’t Sustainable

 Margins can look better in the short term, but if the improvements aren’t built on sustainable practices, they’ll crumble. 

Watch for the quick fixes that mask deeper issues.

→ Investor Decks That Don’t Match Ops Reality

 The numbers on your investor deck can tell a great story, but if they don’t align with what’s actually happening in operations, that story won’t last long. 

A great CFO ensures the narrative matches reality.
→ Incentives Misaligned Across Teams

 If your teams aren’t working toward the same goals, you’re setting yourself up for conflict. Aligning incentives across departments keeps everyone rowing in the same direction.

A great CFO spots these red flags before they become major issues, and takes action to protect the business from unnecessary risks.

The numbers can be misleading if you’re not looking at the right ones.

As a CFO, I see founders make these key mistakes all the time.

Here’s what you need to know

→ Cash ≠ Profit
 Cash flow is critical but it’s not the same as profit. 

Profitability is what ensures your business is sustainable in the long run, not just surviving month-to-month.

→ Headcount ≠ Scale
 Hiring more people doesn’t necessarily mean you're scaling. 

Real scale comes from streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and driving revenue without simply increasing headcount.

→ Raising ≠ Success
 Securing funding is important, but it doesn’t guarantee success. 

How you use that funding, and whether it drives long-term growth, is what ultimately matters.

→ Growth ≠ Health
 Fast growth is exciting, but unchecked growth without a solid foundation can lead to problems down the line. 

A healthy business grows at the right pace and with the right systems in place.

Don’t get caught up in numbers that look good on paper.

Some finance decisions are predictable.

Budgets.
Forecasts.
Cost controls.

But the hardest calls?
The ones that no one prepares you for?
They look like this 

→ Firing a great employee because the business can't afford them anymore.
Numbers don’t care about talent; but leaders have to.

→ Turning down revenue because the margins don’t make sense.
Not all growth is good growth. Some deals cost more than they earn.

→ Telling a founder they need to shut down their business.
Sometimes, the hardest advice is the right advice.

→ Cutting costs in the short term, knowing it will slow growth later.
Cash flow today vs. momentum tomorrow; it’s never an easy trade-off.

→ Defending an investment that isn’t profitable yet.
Great finance leaders know when to say no; but they also know when to double down.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-03-24,"How I scaled a finance team without burning out 
(or burning through budget)

Finance teams don’t fail because they lack talent.

They fail because they scale the wrong way.

Too many companies hire fast, build rigid processes, and overload their teams before they ever become effective.

I’ve built and scaled finance teams across three continents, and here’s what actually works

1. I automated before I hired.

If a process is slow and manual, adding more people won’t fix it.

Automation gave my team time to focus on strategy instead of drowning in reports.

2. I outsourced before I built in-house.

Not every finance function needs a full-time hire.

Leveraging outsourced FP&A support kept costs down while maintaining flexibility.

3. I built thinkers, not just processors.

A finance team that only reports numbers is replaceable.

A team that challenges assumptions and drives better decisions is invaluable.

Scaling isn’t about hiring—it’s about building a system that works.

One that grows with the business.

One that doesn’t burn through budget.

One that doesn’t burn out the team.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2025-03-21,"As we continue to update on SB68 here in Georgia, it’s important to point out that Section 7 of SB68 seeks to modify the Collateral Source Rule, allowing evidence of payments from collateral sources—such as health insurance reimbursements—to be introduced in personal injury cases.

For context, historically the Collateral Source Rule has prevented defendants from reducing their liability by pointing to compensation plaintiffs may have received from other sources. This rule ensures that plaintiffs are fully compensated for their injuries, regardless of any payments from their insurance or other sources.

Proponents of SB68 argue that these changes will enhance transparency in the legal process. But critics like me are concerned that allowing juries to consider these reimbursements could lead to reduced compensation for plaintiffs. In fact, it might discourage healthcare providers from treating injured patients at all, particularly those who are uninsured or underinsured, thereby limiting access to necessary medical care for vulnerable populations.

It’s also worth noting again that the proposed legislation includes provisions that could affect the calculation of noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering. Specifically, SB68 seeks to restrict how attorneys can argue for noneconomic damages, undoubtedly leading to less predictable and lower compensation for plaintiffs.

Do not ignore this important debate. There are implications for all of us.",25,1,2,28,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reidzeising_as-we-continue-to-update-on-sb68-here-in-activity-7308938378375233536-72bL,Gain Company

Ask any CFO, and you’ll get different answers.

Some say profitability is the goal. 

Others argue cash flow is king.

The truth? It depends on your business stage and strategy.

When Cash Flow Matters More
→ Early-stage companies: You can’t scale if you don’t have the cash to operate.

→ High-growth businesses: Investing in expansion often means running at a short-term loss.

→ Tight liquidity periods: If you can’t cover payroll or expenses, profitability on paper won’t help.

When Profitability Matters More
→ Mature businesses: At scale, consistent profitability ensures long-term sustainability.

→ Investor-backed companies nearing an exit: Buyers care about EBITDA and margins.

→ Economic downturns: When financing is harder to secure, profitable companies survive.

My Profile,saulmateos,2025-02-25,"A great finance team does more than close the books.
They drive decisions, shape strategy, and fuel growth.

Here’s how to build one

Hire for insight, not just compliance.
→ A strong team doesn’t just track numbers; they interpret them.
→ Look for professionals who can connect finance to business strategy.

Integrate finance with operations.
→ The best finance teams work alongside leadership to guide decisions.
→ When finance is embedded in the business, strategy becomes data-driven.

Invest in automation and analytics.
→ Free up your team from manual work so they can focus on high-value analysis.
→ Leverage forecasting and scenario planning to stay ahead.

A finance team that understands the business doesn’t just track performance; it improves it.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-02-24,"Most companies think accounting and FP&A are the same.

That’s why they mismanage both.
They expect accountants to forecast the future.
They expect FP&A to clean up the books.
They confuse financial accuracy with financial strategy.
And when numbers don’t add up, they blame the wrong team.

Here’s the truth
📌 Accounting = Precision & Compliance
Keeps the finances clean and accurate.
Ensures compliance with tax laws and regulations.
Provides the data that FP&A relies on.

📌 FP&A = Strategy & Forecasting
Turns financial data into forward-looking insights.
Supports decision-making with projections and scenarios.
Helps leadership understand where the business is headed.

One keeps the business grounded.
The other helps the business scale.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-02-20,"Why Your Cash Flow Forecast Is Wrong 
(And How to Fix It)

Many cash flow forecasts start off with blind spots that make them unreliable.
The question is by how much?

I’ve seen finance teams put together detailed forecasts, only to be blindsided when cash runs tight.
→ Revenue didn’t hit projections.
→ Customers paid later than expected.
→ Unexpected costs threw everything off.

The issue? Their forecast wasn’t built for real life.
→ It relied on perfect-world assumptions instead of real data.
→ It ignored timing mismatches between inflows and outflows.
 →It wasn’t updated often enough to reflect business shifts.

A useful cash flow forecast should
✅ Distinguish between committed cash and expected cash to avoid false confidence.
✅ Include multiple scenarios: best case, worst case, and expected case.
✅ Track actual cash movement, not just projected revenue.

If your forecast isn’t flexible, it’s just a spreadsheet, not a decision-making tool.


How often are you adjusting your cash flow forecast?",13,2,,15,[],https://www.linkedin.com/posts/saulmateos_why-your-cash-flow-forecast-is-wrong-and-activity-7298370826410643456-ucss,Default

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-01-28,"The Secret Art of Direct Cash Flow Forecasting 💡

""Cash is king,"" but when forecasting feels like a guessing game, it’s more roulette than strategy. Indirect methods often rely on broad assumptions, but direct cash forecasting demands precision—especially when every dollar counts.

Throughout my career, I’ve used direct cash flow forecasting to guide decisions in $100B corporations, startups, and SMBs. From navigating market volatility to scaling for growth, real-time cash clarity has consistently been the difference-maker.

Here’s a quick guide to mastering direct cash flow forecasting:

1️⃣ Track Every Dollar: Achieve granular visibility into inflows (sales, collections) and outflows (payroll, rent). This isn’t just a tactical tool—it’s a window into how your business operates.

2️⃣ Focus on the Short Term: While 13-week forecasts are valuable for planning, prioritize actionable insights for the next 4-6 weeks. In challenging times, daily tracking is critical.

3️⃣ Avoid False Precision: A “correct” forecast isn’t always proof of success—it might be luck. Instead, focus on key accounts and ensure your methodology holds up.

4️⃣ Stress-Test Assumptions: Account for risks like payment delays, unexpected expenses, or market shifts to keep your forecast resilient.

5️⃣ Compare and Iterate: Review your forecast against actuals weekly. This process not only sharpens your forecasting skills but also uncovers trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.

When applied effectively, these techniques unlock actionable insights that go beyond mere survival—they empower proactive decisions. Whether it’s making timely hires, optimizing investments, or managing debt obligations, direct forecasting provides the clarity needed to drive stability and growth.

It’s more than a technical skill—it’s a strategic lever that can turn financial uncertainty into opportunity.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2025-01-21,"From Data to Decisions: Turning Numbers into Insights 📊
""Have you ever walked into a meeting with your CEO or leadership team armed with data, only to watch eyes glaze over before you even get to your key points? Turning numbers into insights is an art—and a necessity for today’s CFOs.""

During my time at both Fortune 100 companies and entrepreneurial startups, I’ve learned that numbers are powerful—but only when they tell a compelling story. Without that narrative, even the most detailed reports fall flat.

Here’s how to ensure your data drives decisions:

1️⃣ Start with the 'So What?': Begin with the insights, not the numbers. For example: ""Revenue grew 15%, but customer acquisition costs doubled. Here’s what it means for us.""

2️⃣ Tell a Story with KPIs: At Expedia, I reengineered FP&A processes to reveal real business drivers, allowing us to tie gross margin trends directly to strategic initiatives.

3️⃣ Visualize for Impact: Avoid presenting a wall of numbers. Use visualization tools to bring the story to life and ensure your points resonate.

4️⃣ Prioritize Scenario Planning: Move beyond static reports. What happens if costs rise or revenue dips? Scenario modeling equips leaders to navigate uncertainty with confidence.

5️⃣ Simplify for Clarity: A concise one-page summary can make all the difference. Reserve details for the Q&A or an appendix for deeper dives when needed.

Like many of you, I get countless calls from SDRs. I didn’t always answer them, but now I make an effort to pick up. Why? Because I respect the hustle. Cold calling is tough—it takes grit, resilience, and a willingness to face constant rejection.

Not everyone does it well, but those who master it develop skills that go far beyond sales.

Looking back, one piece of advice I’d give my younger self is to develop stronger sales expertise. Understanding how to connect with people, pitch ideas, and navigate rejection is invaluable—not just for sales, but for leadership, negotiations, and career growth.

To SDRs: Keep going, keep learning, and know your hard work matters.

What’s one skill you’d tell your younger self to prioritize?

Early in your finance career, it’s tempting to hide behind the numbers and simply say, “That’s not in the budget.” But holding the purse strings doesn’t mean you should shy away from understanding the business.

Great finance leaders aren’t just gatekeepers—they’re problem-solvers. Take the time to learn your operating partners’ objectives, challenges, and metrics. The more you align with their goals, the better positioned you are to create financial strategies that enable growth and manage risk.

Remember: Success comes from partnership, not just saying “no.” How do you help your teams move forward?

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2024-12-03,"In this season of giving, I want to highlight some charities that are doing great work to advance the causes we fight for at Gain. 
 
American for Patient Access (APA): Their purpose is to promote and expand access for uninsured and under-insured patients to immediate medical care and to aid medical providers in offering their services to as many patients as possible, regardless of their payor source. 
 
Join and donate here: https://lnkd.in/eFMSdg_s  
 
The HealthWell Foundation: They help those in need overcome financial barriers to receiving high-quality healthcare. Their grants can assist in covering the costs of prescription copays, surgery, and pediatric care. Since their founding in 2003, they have issued over one million grants worth over $2.7 billion to help an estimated 727,000 patients.  
 
Donate here: https://lnkd.in/eznT_eWd  
 
Undue Medical Debt: Medical debt is a crushing burden for millions of Americans, who are often unable to catch up on their unpaid bills on their own. Undue Medical Debt has a transformative impact on patients’ lives by erasing their debt. The charity uses donations to purchase medical debt for pennies on the dollar.  
 
For more information: https://lnkd.in/ewhCeMn6  
 
Help Hope Live: The site started out as a foundation established by a transplant surgeon and his wife, who is a nurse, to help end-stage heart disease patients who had been denied insurance pay for transplants. In the 2000s they expanded their mission to include personal injury patients. In 2019, they marked their 35th anniversary, after having raised $135 million.  
 
On their site, you can either donate to the organization itself, or to one of their many individual crowdfunding campaigns.   
 
Donate here: https://lnkd.in/ekNxEbef  
 
Please feel free to reach out to me with any charities that you believe are worth highlighting.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2024-11-15,"Healthcare providers are navigating complex financial pressures, where the challenge isn’t just about salaries—it’s about sustainability. As Preston Alexander insightfully points out in his recent post, declining reimbursements impact the very existence of private practices, where overhead costs often outweigh revenue. 

In light of these hurdles, accepting medical liens has become a powerful, alternative, premium reimbursement source.  

By accepting personal injury patients on lien, practices can access new revenue streams that can enhance traditional reimbursements. Patients with Letters of Protection (LOPs) offer providers the opportunity to be compensated from settlement proceeds, often yielding higher payments compared to standard insurance reimbursements. 

At Gain, we streamline this process end-to-end. From underwriting cases, adding your practice to the largest Provider Map in the country, to providing financial solutions when needed, to comprehensive lien management, Gain provides the necessary business intelligence tools to target profitable LOP counterparties and maximize reimbursements.   

If you’re ready to explore how medical liens can transform your practice’s financial health, send me a DM and request a consultation today to see how Gain can support your goals.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2024-11-13,"Few places bring the future into focus quite like the YPO’s first-ever Global Business Summit in Dubai—where over 1,000 leaders gathered to discuss strategies and innovations for driving positive change.  

I had the privilege of attending the #YPOGBS24 and the energy there was unmatched. It’s rewarding to witness how our network continuously pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in leadership and innovation.  

The United Arab Emirates’ commitment to advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) was evident throughout the summit. Appointing Omar Sultan AlOlama as the world’s first Minister of State for AI in 2017 shows just how serious they are about shaping the future. He put it best when he said, “Our secret to success is viewing problems and challenges as opportunities for growth.” He described so well that the US are Innovators, the European’s Regulators, the Chinese Imitators and he wants the UAE to be the Accelerators, investing in a non-exclusive manner in emerging technology leaders to further accelerate innovation. This mindset resonates with what we aim for at Gain, where we’re using technology to tackle the complex world of personal injury, making it simpler, faster, and better for everyone involved.  

Another standout moment for me was the discussions on healthcare innovation and emerging AI applications—both critical areas for us at Gain, where we innovate to ensure personal injury patients receive the care and support they deserve. 

Grateful to YPO for another inspiring event and excited to carry this energy back to Gain as we continue to drive change for our industry. It was wonderful to reunite with old friends and build new connections. Thank you to Sofyan Almoayed and the entire team for making this event unforgettable.  

If you attended or have thoughts on the potential of innovation in healthcare, I’d love to connect. How do you see technology making a difference in both the healthcare and legal industries? Let’s keep the conversation going.

I recently read Tim Ferriss’s The 4-Hour Workweek—and while it’s a bit dated, it still sparked some valuable insights. The core message? We often have far more opportunities to automate, streamline, or outsource our work than we realize.

In finance and leadership, it’s easy to fall into the trap of doing things the “traditional way.” But Ferriss’s approach challenges us to re-evaluate. What tasks can we delegate? Where can we use automation to free up time? How can we structure our work to focus on impact, not hours?

I’ve started applying some of these principles to my own routine and my team’s processes. The result? More time for strategic thinking and fewer hours spent on repetitive tasks. It’s a reminder that being “busy” doesn’t always mean being productive.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-08,"""You’re Only as Good as Your Team: Lessons in Building High-Performing Teams 💪""

One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned as a leader is that you’re only as good as the team you build. Creating a high-performing team goes beyond just hiring talented people—it’s about finding the right talent and ensuring each person is positioned to leverage their unique strengths.

When I bring new leaders onto my team, I emphasize two key things:

Understand Your Team’s Strengths: Success doesn’t come from having a group of high achievers; it comes from having the right people in the right roles. Knowing where each team member excels (and where they may struggle) allows you to maximize impact and create a team that’s stronger together.

Find Your Leadership Style: I always tell new leaders that what works for me may not work for them. Leadership isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. The best leaders are those who find their own style—one that feels authentic to them and empowers their team.

At the end of the day, high performance is built on trust, alignment, and a commitment to playing to each person’s strengths. If you want to elevate your team, start by investing in each member’s growth and finding what leadership style drives you.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-05,"No, the Growth Fairy Won’t Fix Your Financial Forecasts 📊

Tom Fishburne's latest cartoon humorously highlights a common challenge in finance—relying on optimism instead of solid strategies. As finance leaders, we’ve all faced the temptation to believe that external market forces will magically turn things around. But this is rarely the case.

In my experience across startups and Fortune 100 companies, meaningful growth comes from internal change, not external hope. It’s through detailed analysis, operational efficiency, and leveraging real-time forecasting models that we reveal the true business drivers.

Financial planning isn’t just about predicting the future—it’s the opportunity to deeply understand what’s happening within the company. When done right, it leverages data to spot opportunities, address inefficiencies, and drive transformative growth.

We can’t clap our hands and hope the Growth Fairy will solve our challenges. Growth is about bold, data-backed decisions and operational discipline. What steps are you taking to ensure sustainable financial growth in your business?

On my way to the Becker's Healthcare Annual ASC Meeting, I sat next to someone wearing a Meta Oculus on the plane and it got me thinking about the power of innovation—how technology continues to shape our lives, especially in healthcare. The possibilities are endless! 

This year's Becker's event was phenomenal—filled with insightful conversations, valuable takeaways, and some of the best networking opportunities.

Thank you to my friend Scott Becker and his entire team for organizing such an impactful event. From connecting with partners to meeting so many passionate professionals, this experience was unforgettable. 

Similar to the Meta Oculus, the Gain platform utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive growth, helping ASC owners and physicians predict case values and increase reimbursements from Letters of Protection (LOPs). This aligns with our mission to ensure that everyone who has been injured through no fault of their own have access to the quality healthcare they deserve.

On behalf of the Gain team, a big thank you to all the ASC owners and healthcare professionals we met—and to those we missed, we’re looking forward to connecting soon. Please reach out for a portal demonstration or to schedule a meeting with me through the link below, I promise to always make time.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-11-01,"Is Finance Stuck in the Past? 🕰️ Reflections on Our Love Affair with Excel

I recently attended a panel with FP&A experts, and one question stood out: “What’s the biggest change in finance over the past 30 years?”

One panelist’s answer was simple: tools. But just a few moments later, he highlighted the enduring benefits of Excel—a tool that’s been around for decades with only minor changes.

This struck me. Here we are in 2023, in a profession that should arguably be at the forefront of technology, yet we’re still heavily reliant on a tool from the 1980s. As an “old timer” myself, I can’t deny it: I use Excel constantly. There’s something about its simplicity and flexibility that feels irreplaceable. But every time I bring up Excel-based solutions, I catch my CTO giving me a look that’s equal parts pain and exasperation.

It’s a reminder that while Excel is familiar and reliable, it’s also holding us back in some ways. In an age of AI, machine learning, and real-time data analytics, we can’t afford to be stuck in the past. The future of finance demands new tools that are faster, smarter, and more collaborative.

So here’s my question for all of you: Is it time for finance to finally move beyond Excel, or will it remain our irreplaceable “Swiss Army knife” for years to come?

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-21,"📚 Great Advice from ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" 💡

I've read ""Influence"" by Robert Cialdini multiple times, and it's one of those books that keeps giving each time. One concept that always strikes me is how bosses tend to give more credit to their teams when they're asked to provide advice on a project. 🤔

It makes so much sense—seeking advice not only strengthens relationships but also encourages a sense of ownership and recognition. I've realized that, subconsciously, I had been using this approach with my managers in the past, and it worked well. Frequently, a few of my team members have also done this with me, which made me acknowledge their work even more.  

Cialdini explains that asking for advice creates a sense of value and involvement, leading to greater commitment and ownership. For bosses, this can boost motivation and engagement—but be careful not to overdo it, or it may seem like you're asking them to do your job.

Have you ever experienced the difference that asking for advice can make in a project or relationship? I'd love to hear your thoughts! 🗣️

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-18,"📈 CPA Pathway Reimagined: A Step Toward Addressing the Accounting Talent Shortage 👨‍💼

There's been a talent shortage in accounting for a while now, but things are finally starting to shift. Deloitte and KPMG are backing a move away from the traditional 150-credit hour requirement for CPA licensure, opting for a more practical work experience pathway instead. This change could make it easier for people to become CPAs, which is good news for both firms and the public. 👍

However, it's important to acknowledge that many of these firms have contributed to the talent shortage by offering relatively lower starting salaries. Let's face it, accounting doesn't have the same reputation as banking or consulting, compounded by lower salaries and strict requirements, but it's also a path to become a CFO. Many of their employees are the future Controllers and CFOs, and now it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire qualified controllers with public accounting experience. Addressing compensation issues alongside changes to licensure requirements could be key to resolving the talent gap. 🤔

What are your thoughts on experience-based pathways to professional licensure? Could this be the change that attracts the next generation of accounting talent? 👩‍🎓

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-10,"Bridging the Gap Between Finance and AI: CFOs as Innovators 🤖💡 
 
As CFOs, embracing AI is no longer optional—it's essential to understanding how it can transform finance and decision-making. While we don't need to become coders, we must familiarize ourselves with AI's practical applications, like machine learning and natural language processing. This isn't about deep technical expertise but about strategically collaborating with AI to explore new models, test ideas, and make decisions faster. 🚀 
 
As highlighted in the recent CFO Dive article, “What must-have AI skills do finance execs need? First, dig in,” CFOs need to relate AI directly to their company's goals. W. Michael Hsu noted that AI becomes a sandbox for strategic thinking, helping CFOs quickly analyze data and model scenarios that fit specific business needs. It's about identifying where AI can drive value, such as anomaly detection, compliance automation, or real-time forecasting. 
 
The key? Experiment with the tools. Start small with focused use cases to see how AI can optimize your operations and improve strategic outcomes.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-07,"Managing Global Teams: Strategies for Success 🌍 
In today’s global business environment, leading dispersed teams opens up opportunities for innovation, diversity, and cost efficiencies. From my experience managing teams across continents, I’ve seen how tapping into global talent pools can boost efficiency and creativity while keeping operational costs in check. For example, hiring in regions with lower living expenses allows companies to access top-tier talent at a fraction of the cost compared to high-expense areas like Silicon Valley. 
 
But managing global teams requires a balance of strategy and flexibility. The article Managing Global Teams: Strategies for Success highlights key challenges such as coordinating across time zones, navigating cultural differences, and ensuring compliance with local labor laws. These obstacles can slow decision-making and complicate communication. However, by establishing clear communication channels, adopting flexible work schedules, and fostering an inclusive culture, these challenges can be overcome.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-10-01,"🔥 Urgency vs. Importance: Stop Putting Out Fires and Start Building Your Team 🔥 
 
In every new role I’ve taken on, there are always urgent matters demanding immediate attention — those fires that seem like they need to be put out right now. But one of the most important priorities that often gets overshadowed by urgency is building a strong team. 
 
🌟 The reality is: Building a high-performing team should never be sidelined. While urgent tasks come and go, a well-constructed team is what ensures long-term success and sustainability. 
 
A strong, capable team not only solves today’s challenges but also drives the company forward in the long run. This team becomes the backbone that helps the company tackle future problems, seize new opportunities, and add real value across all areas — especially in finance, where accurate insights and strategic decisions are crucial to growth. 
 
💡 Those extra hours you spend upfront building a strong team will pay off significantly in the long term. The time invested in finding the right people, training them, and fostering collaboration will yield the highest ROI on your time. A well-built team not only helps manage today’s fires but also becomes the driving force behind tomorrow’s success. 
 
In all my roles, whether in startups or Fortune 1000 companies, I’ve consistently focused on building teams that combine the best existing talent with new hires. This combination of fresh perspectives and institutional knowledge has allowed me to cultivate teams that don’t just execute on immediate needs but also elevate the organization’s capabilities over time. 
 
🔥 Remember: Success doesn’t come from just solving today’s problems; it’s about building the team that will take on tomorrow’s challenges and create lasting value.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-09-19,"Having worked in both global Fortune 1000 companies and high-growth startups, I’ve seen firsthand how the hiring process—and the qualities that lead to success—can vary dramatically between these environments. 
 
In larger companies, the structure and established processes are key. Success often depends on one’s ability to navigate complex organizational hierarchies, work within established frameworks, and drive change in a methodical way. Those who thrive here are often strategic thinkers who excel at managing long-term projects and collaborating across departments. 🤝 
 
In high-growth companies, the environment is entirely different. Speed, agility, and adaptability are crucial. Success in startups often requires a hands-on, “roll-up-your-sleeves” approach and a tolerance for risk and uncertainty. It’s less about following established processes and more about building them from scratch. 🌱🚀 
 
But here’s where the real magic happens: bringing the strengths of each environment into the other. Those who can transfer the structured, strategic thinking of corporate life into the startup world can help implement processes that allow the company to scale efficiently. 🏗️ On the flip side, injecting the creativity, innovation, and speed of startups into large corporations can break down silos, foster a culture of innovation, and drive rapid transformation. 💡 
 
The key is hiring individuals who not only understand these dynamics but can navigate and bridge both worlds. It’s not just about choosing one over the other; it’s about leveraging the best of both to drive growth, regardless of the company size. 🎯

There's something truly exciting about bringing new talent into the company, and I’ve been fortunate to experience many successes in this area. However, I’ve also had my share of failures. 🤝 
 
Through these experiences, I’ve learned that while technical skills are crucial, they’re also the easiest part to assess. It’s the behavioral fit that’s both critical and much more challenging to gauge. No matter how skilled you are at recruiting, mistakes will happen, and not every individual will turn out to be the perfect fit for the role or the company culture. 🧩 
 
In those moments, it's essential to provide support and help them succeed.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-09-03,"💼 In my career, I've seen countless instances where the gap between forecasts and actuals became a focal point. When there's a miss, scrutiny often follows, and I've witnessed people losing their jobs for consistently falling short. However, there's a less discussed but equally dangerous pitfall: not paying attention when you're beating the forecast. 
 
🚩 It's easy to become complacent when numbers look better than expected. But from my experience, this complacency can mask underlying issues that, if left unchecked, could come back to haunt you.

Reid Zeising,reidzeising,2024-08-27,"In today's challenging healthcare landscape, with rising costs, low reimbursements and high denial rates from commercial payors, effectively managing complex claims is crucial for a healthcare organization's financial well-being and growth. I recently had the opportunity to discuss this with Becker's Healthcare, where we delved into the transformative potential of outsourcing Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) for complex claims. 

We discussed the significant opportunities in Personal Injury claims, the importance of handling complex claims with specialized platforms, such as the industry-leading Gain Platform, and success stories that show the real benefits of effective RCM strategies. 

For healthcare providers willing to see Personal Injury patients and looking to improve their financial health and enhance access to quality healthcare for all, this conversation provides valuable insights.

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-08-14,"Accounting Talent Shortage? It’s Time to Think Globally 
 
The shortage of skilled accountants is making it harder—and more expensive—for businesses to keep their financials on track. One solution: global hiring. Beyond just back-office roles, why not extend your manager or director of accounting team offshore? 
 
However, this approach comes with challenges: 
𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗯𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀: Communication across time zones can be tough, but nearshoring can help mitigate this by keeping teams in similar time zones. 
𝗖𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Do you really need a CPA? Depending on the role, local qualifications might suffice, or you could consider hybrid teams that mix U.S.-certified and international experts. Or perhaps, it’s time to rethink the CPA requirement altogether. 
𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳𝗳𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗲: There’s hesitation to move senior roles abroad, but why not? Senior talent outside the U.S. can offer fresh perspectives and strategic value. 
 
With the right approach, global hiring can be more than just a cost-saving measure—it can be a strategic advantage. Are you ready to explore this opportunity?

Saul Mateos,unknown,2024-08-05,"As a CFO, I am constantly interrupted by meetings, notifications, calls, and other disruptions, particularly from my phone. However, finding time for deep, focused work is crucial for driving impactful change and fostering innovation.

Recently, I read ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport, and it has significantly influenced my approach to productivity. Here are a few strategies I've implemented, inspired by the book's teachings:
𝟏. 𝐃𝐨 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐛 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞: Activating this on my phone, with notifications granted only for essential apps (phone, messages, etc.), has helped me create an environment conducive to deep work by minimizing distractions.
𝟐. 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬: Coming from large corporations, I confess there was an overabundance of meetings, and I got used to them. Newport’s advice on minimizing shallow work inspired me to prioritize fewer, more effective meetings that add real value.
𝟑. 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐅𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬: I now allocate specific blocks of time dedicated solely to deep work, as Newport suggests, ensuring I can concentrate on high-priority tasks without interruptions.
𝟒. 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬: Inspired by the principle of focusing on the most important tasks, I ensure that my efforts are directed towards activities that yield the highest value and drive meaningful results.
𝟓. 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚: By reducing time spent on social media, I follow Newport’s guidance on eliminating shallow activities, which helps me maintain focus and productivity.

Implementing these strategies has transformed my productivity and focus, allowing me to make a greater impact. How do you manage distractions and ensure you have time for deep work? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

I highly recommend ""Deep Work"" to anyone looking to enhance their focus and productivity. Let's prioritize what truly matters and drive meaningful results.

At Gain, we believe in simplifying the management of personal injury cases, providing ASCs with a vital source of reimbursement and ensuring greater access to care for those in need. It's alarming to consider that 100 million Americans, 30 million of whom are uninsured, have less than four weeks of savings. For those injured through no fault of their own, access to quality care becomes a significant challenge. 

Serving personal injury patients on lien not only fulfills a moral obligation but also represents a premium reimbursement source for ASCs. It's a strategy that can help counter the declining reimbursements we're seeing across the board. It's about doing the right thing for personal injury patients and our healthcare system.

First season of sports ended and it left us with lessons to combat #covid19 as infection rates are at an all time high around the country.

1. Testing is crucial. The professional leagues test often. Clearly we will not be doing that but before you have family gatherings, test.  
2. Behave like you are in a bubble. Stay close with a few people, keep your network small and request collective participation.
3. Pandemic fatigue is real. Keep in mind you will get less cautious. See more people. Go to more places.
