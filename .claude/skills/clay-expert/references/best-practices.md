# Clay Best Practices & Optimization Guide

## Table Design Principles

### 1. One Entity Type Per Table
**❌ Wrong**: Mixing companies and people in the same table
**✅ Right**: Separate tables for companies and people

**Why**: Different data structures, different enrichment needs

**Example structure**:
- `companies` table: domain, name, size, industry, funding
- `people` table: name, email, phone, job_title, company_id
- Link them: Use "Lookup" to reference company data from people table

### 2. Master Tables for Frequently Used Data
**Concept**: Build centralized "source of truth" tables

**Example**: Master contacts table
- Contains all enriched contact data
- Other tables reference it via lookup
- Avoids re-enriching same person multiple times

**How to implement**:
1. Create master table: `master_contacts`
2. In new workflow: First lookup in master table
3. If found: Use existing data (free)
4. If not found: Enrich and add to master table

**Result**: 10x credit savings on repeat lookups

### 3. Clear Column Naming Conventions
**❌ Wrong**: Generic names like "Email", "Email2", "Email3"
**✅ Right**: Descriptive names like "Hunter_Email", "Apollo_Email", "Final_Email"

**Benefits**:
- Know which provider returned each value
- Easier to debug waterfall logic
- Clearer for teammates

**Recommended prefixes**:
- Provider name: `Apollo_Email`, `ZoomInfo_Phone`
- Status: `Final_Email`, `Verified_Email`
- Source: `CRM_Email`, `Form_Email`, `Enriched_Email`

### 4. Add Context Columns
**Include metadata columns**:
- `enrichment_date`: When was this enriched?
- `data_source`: Which provider found this?
- `confidence_score`: How confident are we?
- `last_validated`: When was this last verified?

**Why**: Helps with data hygiene and debugging

### 5. Use Views for Different Workflows
**Concept**: Filter same table different ways

**Example**: Sales SDR workflows
- View 1: "New Leads" (status = new)
- View 2: "Contacted" (status = contacted)
- View 3: "Replied" (status = replied)

**Benefits**: One table, multiple use cases

## Workflow Optimization

### Start Simple, Then Scale
**Phase 1: Manual (Day 1)**
- Manually add 10 test records
- Build enrichment logic
- Verify outputs

**Phase 2: Semi-Automated (Week 1)**
- Import 100 records via CSV
- Run enrichments
- Monitor credit usage

**Phase 3: Fully Automated (Month 1)**
- Connect to live data sources
- Auto-trigger on new records
- Build alerts and monitoring

**Don't skip Phase 1!** Test on small dataset first.

### Use Conditional Runs to Save Credits
**Concept**: Only run enrichments when needed

**Example 1: Don't re-enrich if data exists**
```
IF "email" column is empty
  THEN run email enrichment
ELSE skip
```

**Example 2: Only enrich qualified leads**
```
IF company_size > 100 AND industry = "Software"
  THEN run premium enrichment (ZoomInfo)
ELSE use budget enrichment (Apollo)
```

**Example 3: Progressive enrichment**
```
IF lead_score > 80
  THEN enrich phone number + direct dial
ELSE just enrich email
```

**How to implement**: Use "Run if" conditions in enrichment settings

### Batch Processing for Efficiency
**❌ Wrong**: Real-time enrichment of every single lead
**✅ Right**: Batch enrich every 6-24 hours

**Benefits**:
- Easier to monitor and debug
- Can review results before pushing downstream
- Less strain on APIs

**When to use real-time**: Inbound leads that need instant routing

**When to use batch**: Outbound prospecting, list building

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
**Always have a Plan B**

**Example: Email finding with fallback**
```
Step 1: Try Hunter.io
  → Success? Great, move on
  → Failed? Try Step 2

Step 2: Try Apollo.io
  → Success? Great, move on
  → Failed? Try Step 3

Step 3: Mark as "no_email_found"
  → Don't leave blank
  → Track failure for analysis
```

**Benefits**:
- Know what's working vs failing
- Can revisit "no_email_found" records later
- Better reporting

## Credit Optimization Strategies

### 1. Pre-Qualification Filters
**Save 80% of credits by filtering first**

**Example: B2B SaaS outbound**
```
Before enriching, filter for:
- Company size: 50-5,000 employees
- Industry: Software, Technology, SaaS
- Location: United States, Canada
- Funding: Seed to Series C

Result: 100,000 raw leads → 8,000 qualified leads
Credit savings: 92% fewer enrichments
```

### 2. Tiered Enrichment Strategy
**Not all leads deserve premium enrichment**

**Tier 1: High-value leads (ICP match)**
- Use premium providers (ZoomInfo, RocketReach)
- Enrich everything (email, phone, mobile)
- Verify data quality
- Budget: $0.50-$1.00 per lead

**Tier 2: Medium-value leads**
- Use standard providers (Apollo, Hunter)
- Enrich basics (email, job title)
- Budget: $0.10-$0.20 per lead

**Tier 3: Low-value leads**
- Use budget providers only
- Enrich email only
- Budget: $0.01-$0.05 per lead

**Implementation**: Use lead scoring + conditional enrichments

### 3. Smart Waterfall Design
**Optimize for coverage AND cost**

**Example: Email finding waterfall analysis**
```
Provider 1 (Hunter): Finds 60% at $0.01 = $0.006 avg
Provider 2 (Apollo): Finds 25% more at $0.05 = $0.0125 avg
Provider 3 (ZoomInfo): Finds 10% more at $0.50 = $0.05 avg

Total coverage: 95%
Average cost per successful lookup: $0.07
```

**Decision**: Keep all 3 providers or stop at 2?
- If conversion rate justifies cost → Keep all 3
- If not → Stop at Provider 2 (85% coverage at $0.02 avg)

### 4. Data Validation Before Enrichment
**Don't waste credits on bad data**

**Common validations**:
- Email format: Must contain "@" and domain
- LinkedIn URL: Must be complete profile URL
- Company name: Not generic terms like "LLC" or "Inc."
- Phone number: Proper length and format

**Implementation**: Use formulas to validate, conditional runs to skip bad data

### 5. Caching and Deduplication
**Never enrich the same person twice**

**Strategy 1: Master lookup table**
- Check master table first
- Only enrich if not found
- Add to master after enrichment

**Strategy 2: Dedup before enriching**
- Remove duplicate emails before enriching
- Remove duplicate LinkedIn URLs
- Enrich unique records only

**Result**: 50-70% credit savings on typical workflows

## Data Quality Best Practices

### 1. Always Validate Emails
**Don't send to invalid emails**

**Validation steps**:
1. Format validation (formula: contains "@" and ".")
2. Deliverability check (Hunter, ZeroBounce, NeverBounce)
3. Risk scoring (catch-all, disposable, role-based)

**Cost**: $0.001-$0.01 per validation
**ROI**: Avoid bounce rate >5% (protects sender reputation)

### 2. Cross-Validate Critical Data
**Use multiple sources for important data**

**Example: Executive phone numbers**
```
Source 1: ZoomInfo → (555) 123-4567
Source 2: RocketReach → (555) 123-4567
Source 3: Apollo → (555) 987-6543

Decision: 2 out of 3 match → High confidence
Formula: Use majority vote
```

### 3. Freshness Tracking
**Know how old your data is**

**Add columns**:
- `enriched_date`: When was this enriched?
- `data_age_days`: How many days since enrichment?
- `needs_refresh`: TRUE if >90 days old

**Refresh strategy**:
- Critical data (phones): Refresh every 30 days
- Standard data (emails): Refresh every 90 days
- Static data (company size): Refresh every 180 days

### 4. Confidence Scoring
**Not all enriched data is equal**

**Scoring system**:
- **High confidence**: Multiple sources agree
- **Medium confidence**: Single source, recent
- **Low confidence**: Single source, old, or pattern-guessed

**Example formula**:
```
IF multiple_sources_match AND data_age < 30 days
  THEN "High"
ELSE IF single_source AND data_age < 90 days
  THEN "Medium"
ELSE "Low"
```

**Usage**: Only call low-confidence numbers, email high-confidence

### 5. Data Hygiene Routines
**Schedule regular cleanup**

**Weekly tasks**:
- Remove duplicates
- Validate new emails
- Check for blank critical fields

**Monthly tasks**:
- Refresh old data (>90 days)
- Archive stale leads
- Audit credit usage by provider

**Quarterly tasks**:
- Review provider performance
- Optimize waterfalls
- Update ICP filters

## Formula Best Practices

### 1. Use the AI Generator (Don't Write Manually)
**❌ Wrong**: Trying to learn formula syntax
**✅ Right**: Describe what you want in plain English

**Example requests**:
- "Extract everything before @ in email address"
- "If job_title contains VP, return Senior, else Junior"
- "Combine first_name and last_name with a space"
- "Calculate days between hire_date and today"

**Why**: AI is faster and more accurate than manual syntax

### 2. Reference Columns Dynamically
**❌ Wrong**: Hardcoding values in formulas
**✅ Right**: Using /column_name references

**Example**:
```
❌ Wrong: "Concatenate 'John' and 'Doe'"
✅ Right: "Concatenate /first_name and /last_name"
```

**Why**: Works across all rows, updates automatically

### 3. Test on Sample Before Full Run
**Always preview formula output**

**Steps**:
1. Write formula prompt
2. Generate formula
3. Review sample output (Clay shows preview)
4. Adjust if needed
5. Click "Apply to all rows"

**Why**: Catch errors before processing 10,000 rows

### 4. Add Error Handling
**Handle missing or unexpected data**

**Example: Safe concatenation**
```
❌ Risky: "Concatenate /first_name and /last_name"
✅ Safe: "If /first_name is empty, return /last_name,
         else if /last_name is empty, return /first_name,
         else concatenate /first_name and /last_name"
```

**Why**: Prevents blank outputs or errors

### 5. Document Complex Formulas
**Add notes for future you**

**In column name or description, add**:
- What it does
- Which columns it uses
- Any special logic

**Example column name**:
`Lead_Score (formula: +10 if title=VP, +5 if company>1000)`

## Automation Best Practices

### 1. Start with Triggers
**Automate based on events**

**Common triggers**:
- New row added to table
- Field value changes
- Scheduled time (daily, weekly)
- Webhook from external system

**Example: Inbound lead automation**
```
Trigger: New form submission → Webhook to Clay
Action 1: Create new row in leads table
Action 2: Enrich contact data
Action 3: Score lead
Action 4: Route to sales rep
Action 5: Send to CRM
```

### 2. Use Clay Integrations (Not Manual Exports)
**❌ Wrong**: Export CSV → Import to CRM manually
**✅ Right**: Direct integration (Clay → Salesforce)

**Benefits**:
- Real-time updates
- No manual work
- Fewer errors
- Audit trail

**Available integrations**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Attio, etc.

### 3. Build Feedback Loops
**Learn from what works**

**Example: Email outreach feedback**
```
1. Send emails via Instantly
2. Track opens, clicks, replies
3. Push results back to Clay
4. Analyze: Which job titles reply most?
5. Adjust: Focus on high-reply segments
```

**Result**: Continuously improving targeting

### 4. Set Up Alerts and Monitoring
**Know when things break**

**Alerts to set up**:
- Daily credit usage > threshold
- Enrichment failure rate > 50%
- Critical workflow failed
- New high-score lead added

**Tools**: Clay notifications, Slack webhooks, email alerts

### 5. Version Control for Workflows
**Track changes to avoid breaking things**

**Best practices**:
- Duplicate table before major changes
- Name versions: "Leads_v1", "Leads_v2"
- Document what changed
- Keep previous version for 30 days

**Why**: Easy rollback if new logic breaks

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Not Filtering Before Enriching
**Problem**: Enriching 50,000 raw leads without qualification

**Cost**: $5,000-$10,000 in wasted credits

**Solution**: Add qualification filters first
- Company size in target range
- Job titles match ICP
- Industry is relevant
- Location is serviceable

**Result**: Enrich 5,000 qualified leads for $500-$1,000

### Mistake 2: Using Same Provider for Everything
**Problem**: Only using Apollo or only using ZoomInfo

**Cost**: Either poor coverage (Apollo) or high cost (ZoomInfo)

**Solution**: Use waterfalls to balance cost and coverage
- Start with affordable providers
- Fall back to premium providers
- Achieve 90%+ coverage at reasonable cost

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Data Freshness
**Problem**: Using 2-year-old enriched data

**Cost**: Bounced emails, wrong numbers, wasted outreach

**Solution**: Track enrichment date, refresh periodically
- Add `enriched_date` column
- Refresh every 90 days
- Re-verify before major campaigns

### Mistake 4: Over-Complicating Workflows
**Problem**: Building 20-step workflows on day 1

**Cost**: Hard to debug, breaks often, team confused

**Solution**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Week 1: Basic enrichment only
- Week 2: Add filtering and scoring
- Week 3: Add integrations
- Week 4: Add advanced logic

### Mistake 5: No Credit Monitoring
**Problem**: Not tracking spend until bill arrives

**Cost**: $10,000 surprise bill

**Solution**: Check daily, set budgets, use alerts
- Check credit usage dashboard daily
- Set monthly budget limit
- Enable email alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%
- Review cost per lead weekly

## Advanced Tips

### 1. Use AI for Personalization at Scale
**Beyond basic enrichment**

**Example: Personalized icebreakers**
```
Inputs: LinkedIn profile, recent posts, company news
Prompt: "Write a 1-sentence personalized opener referencing
         this person's recent LinkedIn post or company news"
Output: Unique icebreaker for each prospect
```

**Cost**: $0.01-$0.05 per generation
**ROI**: 3-5x higher reply rate

### 2. Build Custom Scrapers
**For data not in standard providers**

**Use cases**:
- Scrape company job boards
- Monitor competitor pricing pages
- Track product feature launches
- Follow funding announcements

**Tools**: Apify, PhantomBuster, custom scripts

### 3. Combine Multiple Signals
**Better targeting through data fusion**

**Example: Intent scoring**
```
Signals:
- Visited pricing page (1st party)
- Downloaded whitepaper (1st party)
- Company expanding (ZoomInfo intent)
- Hiring for your solution role (LinkedIn)
- Recent funding round (Crunchbase)

Score: Sum of signals
Action: High score → Personal outreach
        Low score → Nurture campaign
```

### 4. Reverse Enrichment
**Start with rich data, find basic data**

**Example: LinkedIn → Email**
```
Traditional: Email → LinkedIn profile
Reverse: LinkedIn profile → Email

Why: LinkedIn has rich data (job history, posts, connections)
     Use this to find better prospects, then enrich email
```

**Process**:
1. Search LinkedIn for ICP profiles
2. Scrape profile data (Apify)
3. Enrich email (waterfall)
4. Enrich phone (waterfall)

### 5. Build Lookalike Audiences
**Find more people like your best customers**

**Process**:
1. Export your best customers from CRM
2. Enrich in Clay (company, industry, technologies)
3. Analyze patterns (what do they have in common?)
4. Build search for similar prospects
5. Enrich and reach out

**Example patterns**:
- Company size: 200-2,000 employees
- Industry: B2B SaaS
- Technologies: Uses Salesforce + HubSpot
- Growth: Series B-C funding in last 12 months
